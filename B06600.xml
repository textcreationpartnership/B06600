            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riend and Chriſtian Reader, it is the property of divine truth after it is manifeſted in the ſpirit, to inflame a ſoul with it, and to ſwallow up the ſpirit in the glory of it; ſo as it is as impoſſible for a ſoul to enjoy truth and not to declare it, as for a man to carry fire in his boſome or mouth, and not be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Saints are mightily conſtrained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they enjoy Truth, from the fire of Love, to declare it. Now I have had ſad experien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the waies of my own heart, how I have conſtantly Rested below God, and ſo have fallen ſhort of his glory. This being my condition for a long time, though in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:174689:4"/> particular ſeeming to be God, and of God, and in it my condition happy; where I was continually running from mountain to hill, becauſe I knew not the true Reſt. But at laſt it pleaſed the Father of ſpirits to reveal himſelf, and by the ſame to make them manifeſt. Whereupon I have had much wrastling in my own ſpirit, about putting the ſame out to publique view; but at last was forced to break through much oppoſition in my own heart, and to put it out in his imperfect Form. That if it be the wiſdome of God in the ſame, others by me may learn to beware: yet I would not have bin without the experience of the ſame, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is the will of God now to deſſolve it. Wherefore Chriſtian Reader, I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe enſuing particulars to thee, and thee to the wiſdome of the Spirit, whereby thou mayeſt judge of the ſame in love.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If thou canst cloſe with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of my diſcourſe, and after finding ſome circumstances which are either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:174689:4"/> to thee, or obſtruct to thy principles; yet do not flye out into bitterneſſe of ſpirit, againſt what thou judgeſt truth, neither againſt that which thou judgeſt no truth; but receive the one, and let the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, untill God reveal tbe ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; lest thou be found calling light darkneſſe, and darkneſſe light, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil of things thou knoweſt not; but in meekneſſe judge, and Reſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If thou haſt not paſſed through theſe, or all theſe Rests or Diſpenſations, or haſt not as yet attained to many things herein expreſſed; yet let them have thy charitable thoughts, and do not as moſt do, fly out againſt them as Errors, becauſe they are not either within their reach as to high for them, or becauſe they are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their preſent principles, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> would unbottom them; or becauſe they are not according to what they have been taught, or is experienced in them: But judge of them in love; and where any thing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thy experience, I wiſh thou mayeſt
<pb facs="tcp:174689:5"/> be ſilent in it, and waite to know it, if it be of God: and if it be too low for thee, let it receive encouragement from thee, as thou haſt paſſed to thy estate through theſe <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Christian Reader, paſſe by any infirmity thou ſeeſt, either in expreſſion, form or method: look upon them to be a diſcourſe of experience, more to edify, then to pleaſe the fancy, <hi>by curioſity of words in mans wiſdome,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Do not judge me to deny any thing which I do not here affirm, becauſe I am ſpeaking ſpiritual things within: But look upon it as a ſpirituall, and inward diſcourſe; holding out the two great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>viz.</hi> The Myſtery of Christ made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Spirit within man: and the Myſtery of the creature to himſelfe. Do not think I am going about to deſtroy the low workings of God, I am not: Neither be much daunted if God hereby lets thee behold the face of ſelf &amp; falſe Reſts, ſo as it brings thee to a loſſe: But beleeve it, thy greatest
<pb facs="tcp:174689:5"/> loſſe may in time become thy greateſt gain: For that which moves me to write theſe few lines is, that if it be the will of God, Creatures may ſee the many falſe waies and Reſts below God: That Creatures may not live ſhort of his glory as I have done.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall deſire that I may not be miſtaken, either in my intentions or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and therefore ſhall commend this farther to the Reader; Firſt, to take off a ſcruple which may lye upon many, whether I do deny theſe ſeventeen Reſts to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God, and the way God leades men into their ſpirituall Reſt, which is Chriſts coming in the Spirit: That I may clear this, and make farther way; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, it is Gods way to lead creatures through theſe particulars: But the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſelf, and the deceivableneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will reſemble the leadings of God, and ſo will labour to live, and keep the ſoul to reſt ſhort of God; &amp; man in going after the wayes of his own heart, may ſeem to be led by God: But in theſe particulars I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
<pb facs="tcp:174689:6"/> to drive on two things, the firſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what the way of mans heart is, when it will deceive, and what glory it will appear to the Creature in, untill God undeceive it: ſo that I am first to undeceive Creatures, in their unſound confidence, concluding their eſtates to be ſo high that they are at Reſt in God, when they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a covering, but not of the ſpirit. And though the heart be putting God in the forefront of its actings, yet it is but <hi>Jehues</hi> deceit and treachery of ſpirit. Secondly, I labour to undeceive it, that though it hath attained any, or all theſe ſeventeen, and have not had an appearance of Chriſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in them, ſo that they know when, and how, and what Christ infallibly was, that ſtill that ſoul is but yet in a changable condition: And it may as well be Satans transformings in him, as any diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God to him: and to let the creature know, that though he have paſſed through all this, yet he wants on thing to be his reſt and center; which when it comes, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb facs="tcp:174689:6"/> the truth of all theſe diſpenſations: and if they be of God, they ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if they be of ſelf or Satan, they ſhall be deſtroyed: So that to unbottom Creatures, that they live not upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ity &amp; lyes, &amp; that they may not reſt before the true appearance of Chriſt in the ſpirit, I have ſet forth theſe imperfect lines. Farther, I would not have any think that I deny Scriptures, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Chriſts coming in the fleſh, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome after death, or any thing here I have inſerted to be falſe Reſts: but that I am at, is to ſet all things in its proper place, and to bring ſoules to ſee the true center; that they may not miſſe the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, while they are acting beyond their line: in which actings themſelves may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come caſt-aways, and that men may know that neither Scriptures, or Chriſt in the fleſh, Ordinances, or Members of Churches, or the Kingdome after death, or the form of words in the Letter, or Promiſes, is the Rest of Saints; but He who is the ſum and ſubſtance of all, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt in the Spirit
<pb facs="tcp:174689:7"/> coming in us, to be Life, Glory, Light and Happineſſe to us; and ſo an hope of glory in us This is the Reſt of Saints; but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader, God now in theſe days is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the falſe coverings of creatures, and ſostripping them naked; God is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men tr ſee this great mystery of ſelf in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s glory: He is annihilating creatures and bringing them to a ſpirituall death: He is laying low mountains, and un-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toming and un-resting Creatures; Mens lofty looks He is abaſing: yea He is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men who have bin ſtars, and ſomthing in their own and others eyes, even to a loſs and ſilence, confuſion and darkneſs; That now their light is darkneſs, their wiſdome folly, their life death, their enlargements and ſelf-actings hedged up, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find out any of their former paths; ſo that now they are made to waite in ſilence, as well as the Author of this book was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do; and it may be the wiſdome of God, that this particular ſhall be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good, as well in this, as it hath bin
<pb facs="tcp:174689:7"/> before it came in this publick view, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls, in another manner and method; ſo that I ſhall leave them, to receive at thy hands what cenſure the wiſdom of God pleaſeth to cauſe or permit, wiſhing thy exceeding happineſſe in the Spirit.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Reſt which we ſhall ſpeak of is, Civility, or a common reſtraint of the Creature from the committing of groſſe evils: looked upon by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be Reformation. This conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diſpenſation, ſpeaks deceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peace to many a ſpirit; upon the which ſeeming good, which pretends to follow this ſtate, the creature reſteth and is ſatisfied. But the reaſon thereof partly flowes from theſe following grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From comparing himſelf with others: that is looking upon the groſneſſe of mens actions abroad in the world: as namely, ſwearing and drunkenneſſe, and the height of all prophanes many ſpirits live in, where they are in the ſame condion, <hi>Drinking up iniquity</hi> as if they were drinking up water: &amp; in theſe particulars hee being reſtrained, and more civillized then thoſe, he bleſſeth himſelf in his preſent condition, and Reſts ſatisfied with it, as though in it he did enjoy much of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It flowes from comparing his condition preſent with what it was: The more groſſer his condition was before, the higher it works him into conceit, with the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:174689:9"/> happines of its preſent condition. Thus not ſeeing the purity of God, and the deceitfulnes of its own ſpirit within; he comparing himſelf with himſelf is deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo reſts ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It flowes from the conſideration of the greatnes of love (he had before being reſtrained) to thoſe groſſe evils he is reſtrained from; together with the greatnes of the power, which he cals the divine power of God, which thus reſtraines him, and thus he reaſons, if God did not highly love me, I ſhould never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a power from him as to ſhake off, and not only ſo, but to hate and obhorre thoſe groſſe ſins I ſo deerly loved, both in my ſelf and others; and now the very practiſe of them, being as he conceives, hated by him, ads weight to his thus reaſoning out the love of God. Another thing which ads weight is, his often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt ſuch particular ſins as yet remaines unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; &amp; afterwards theſe being ſubdued (he looks upon acceptance with God in this being) he looks upon it as an anſwer of prayer; and ſo in the ſame, he reaſons out love in this condition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It flowes from the ſeeming ſorrow, which ariſeth continually, upon the view of his former condition, which workes a ſeeming repenatnce and reformation; and from the ſorrow he hath for his former condition; now having a work of Reformation, he Reſts under the notion of happineſſe; yet not all this time brought home to ſee the groſneſſe of his heart within; but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſhing the outſide, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 39. and being a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wall, glorious without, it is all he looks for, or ſeeks after. But Satan and mans heart will ſuffer the creature to act ſo farre, and propound ſuch waies to himſelf, as in the ſame to bring the ſoul into a ſtate of ſecurity, where it may reſt under the conſideration of being happy; and not without ſome viſible ground, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent both to the creature thus deceived, and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:174689:9"/> World who are not ſpirituall diſcoverers: But alas, what is it for any to be inſtruments to pull down, or to be reſtrainers from Idolatry without, when indeed there is remaining the cauſe of all Idolatry of Spirit within: To be outwardly drunk no more, &amp; yet to be drunk with the high conceipts of himſelf, which is neither <hi>with</hi> wine nor ſtrong drink; its <hi>worſe</hi> for a man to have the branches broken down, before the root be pulled up: for a man to be ſeemingly a Saint, &amp; a devil within, in this eſtate there is no ſure Reſt: but <hi>thus it is moſt commonly</hi> with men, they conclude they <hi>are</hi> happy, if they have but the leaſt appearance of it in a viſible reſtraining of them from groſs evils: &amp; in this they appear to themſelves and others men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; &amp; ſo new creatures, when indeed they <hi>are</hi> ſtil in their blood, though they have eſcaped <hi>the</hi> common pollution of the World, through a general knowledge of Chriſt, which is no ſure cauſe of Reſt, until there be a particular knowledge of him, by which the creature is cleanſed from all pollutions both of fleſh &amp; ſpirit, which makes the heart upright before God, from this inward knowledge of God, which carries up the ſpirit of a ſpirituall man into God, where he comes to be truly centred up in God: ſo that the heart and Satan, being deceitful, as to ſuffer the creature to eſcape the common pollutions of the World, ſo that it may but there keep the Creature.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing in this eſtate of darknes none can truly judge of its condition aright, until <hi>the</hi> true light <hi>come</hi> in, which makes all things manifeſt: Then it behoves ſouls in this eſtate, though to themſelves <hi>never</hi> ſo <hi>ſeem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ingly</hi> glorious, not to reſt ſatisfied with, or content it ſelf in it, as though it did enjoy <hi>God,</hi> in the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; but to wait for a higher diſpenſation; and then the truth of this diſpenſation ſhall be diſcovered whether it be of God or man; if of God, it ſhall be

                  <head>The Second falſe Reſt.</head>
                  <p>THe ſecond Reſt moſt commonly of Souls, after a common reſtraining the Creature from groſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, is a work ſeeming to the Creature ſomething high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and that is in obedience unto what the Law of God requires.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, A negative Obedience from ſomething. The ſecond, is an affirmative Obedience to ſomething; and this ſeems to the Creature to go beyond the other and ſo become a ſurer foundation of Reſt: when indeed it is all one with the other, and ſtill ſhort of the true Reſt: And here comes it to paſſe, that in this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation man hath no longer peace, then he acts ſutable to the Law; break the Law, and it breaks the neck of the Souls peace: Keep it, &amp; it keeps the Soul in peace.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, in this condition it comes to paſſe, that the Creature is wholly caſt down, and begins to queſtion all he hath, yea, the very foundation of all: when in the leaſt manner he doth tranſgreſſe. But ſtill the ſoul is in a very low and empty diſpenſation: but mans obedience to the Law (wherein he intends by his obedience to it, to get happineſſe and life from it) flowes from theſe particulars following.</p>
                  <p>1. From a convincement of his miſery our of God, in which he ſees a want of God; upon which he runnes unto the Law, being convinced by it, to ſee what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of it. He now reſolves, makes Covenants, Vowes, renewes them often, and purpoſeth to do what he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:174689:12"/> Law requires: To this end he fals aboard of praying reading, keeping Sabbaths, and ſpends nights and daie, in labouring to attaine to what the Law requires And.</p>
                  <p>1. The Law requiring, as the principall part of it, Love. Now this is the daily complant of ſuch a ſoule in this diſpenſation: Oh that I could love God, then I could believe God loved me: then it being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Law, I could believe it were fullfilled either in me or for mee; then ſhould I enjoy peace, and Reſt in my ſpirit; not knowing that our love to God nowes from the manifeſtations of Gods love in us; not conſidering that the law is fullfilled by another; not knowing that peace and reſt flowes from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; and not from ſutable Quallifications to the Law of God: but now, when the ſoul hath, as he conceives, got ſo much love to God, as partly the Law of God requires; it Reſts, concluding this, That love to God is an infallible Token of Love from God: Yet not knowing that the way to judge aright of my love to God, is from the enjoyments of Love from God: And here lies the great deceit of many ſpirits Again, The Law requires Sabbath keeping, and many ſuch like comands are required: The ſoul cries, Oh that I could keepe the Sabbath. Oh that my heart could keep cloſe with God upon that day: and here the ſoul labours to bring his heart into that frame, not to think his own thoughts or ſpeak his owne words; whereupon he ſets a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the morning, and exerciſes himſelfe in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties agreable to the day: now if he keep the day ſo exact, as he thinkes the Law requires, he Reſts with much peace: but if he be dead, and cold, and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in theſe Diſpenſations he imployes himſelfe in then he can have no peace all the week, but is mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grieving he hath broke the Law: and here is partly the frame of ſuch a ſpirit.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:174689:13"/>
                  <p> And the ſecond cauſe of his thus acting is, from an apprehenſion of wrath, and a condemning conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hell within, it would doe any thing to aſſawg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> would not a ſoule doe or attempt, to remove the ſame, being at preſent too heavy for the ſoul to bear: now it would do any thing to ſtoppe the mouth of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning conſcience, though it will pretend what it doth is for no ſuch matter: but the flatterings of the heart, and the gloſſe it puts upon the actions of the Creature in this Diſpention.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſoul not diſcerning ſatisfaction given to God by another: it labours therefore to ſatisfie God for the breach it hath made betwixt it and God; though I ſay the heart here will gloſſe its actions, and ſay to the contray. But now it ſeeing a breach, this breach muſt be made up before there can be peace: Now the ſoule not ſeeing the breach made up by Chriſt, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make up the breach by his actuall obedience to the Law of God: And therefore is it that men teach this Principle: The way to attain grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God is, by ſuch a humiliation or ſorrow as they call God: And here they prove Aegyptian Task-maſters, to ſet the Creature upon doing, when he hath no ſtraw to work withall, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 13. 14. And this is uſuall with Creatures in this Diſpenſation, when they ſee themſelves in bondage, to get freedome by doing.</p>
                  <p>And ſo comes it to paſſe many breake priſon before they be ſet free by the Spirit: As for inſtance, when the ſoule can finde ſuch a Qualification in him, or ſuch a frame of Spirit in him, as the Law requires, having a long time laboured for it, he judgeth himſelf to be ſet free by Chriſt, when it is but a conceited freedome, as an effect of his obedience: and not as an effect of the obedience of Chriſt revealed to him in the Spirit. And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:174689:13"/> in this particular the Creature is like a horſe that is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into a bogmire, he labours to plunge himſelfe out leſt he periſh there, and indeed plunges himſelfe faſter in, and brings himſelfe into a nigher way of periſhing: Thus the Creature ſeeing himſelfe falne into miſery and bondage, he labours and plunges to free himſelfe, untill he plunges himſelf into higher bondage: and as the horſe will not give over, and lye ſtill until he hath wearied himſelfe, no more will the ſoul ceaſe acting to free himſelf, untill he be wearied and worne out of breath: And then he ſhall be forced to wait until He who delivers Saints out of the pit where no water is, come and deliver his Spirit out of its ſlavery and bondage. And alſo in an eſtate of darkneſſe the like, the Creature labours for light, and being incompaſſed about with pits on every ſide, and being in darkneſſe he will not ſtay until the Light come, or the day dawn; but at laſt for want of a Guide, which is the Spirit, he fals into the pit, where he lies more ſadder then ever. John 16. 15.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the common, though ſad effects of thoſe who run before God leades them, and either the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reſts after he hath attained qualifications ſutable to the Law, or elſe brought up into a higher obedience to the Law: or he remaines ſenſibly miſerable of the greater miſery in it then before: which though it be more ſadder to the apprehenſion, yet it is the way of God in the Creature, thus to fruſtate the expectation of the Creature in its labouring to work happineſſe for it ſelf, until happineſſe be revealed within it.</p>
                  <p>The Third cauſe is, from the principle of Nature and here the Covenant of works is moſt ſutable to the principles of Nature: Nature would alwaies be doing, though in its doing, it inſtead of acting to God, is acting from God: For it is impoſſible that man can truly act to God, before there be an acting of God in him. So
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:174689:14"/> that man cannot aſcend up to God, before there be deſcending of God into the ſoul; which Deſcendings I call a reall manifeſtation of life within man, which is God; being a Fountaine breaking forth againe from man unto God: And before that, though ſoules act never ſo gloriouſly, yet they are but <hi>Adams</hi> running away from God, and from the principles of Nature, clothing themſelves, Gen. 3. 8. Which in time, though man Reſt upon it, proves ſelfe righteouſneſſe, or a righteouſneſſe according to the Law, and not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God by faith; and ſo his Reſt and peace ſhall be taken from him, and deſtroyed in him.</p>
                  <p>4. The cauſe from which his thus acting flowes, is from ſelf-love; and this will go beyond any thing formerly mentioned. Self-love in the gaining of its own ends, will thinke nothing too difficult to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nothing too deare to part withall, unleſſe the things we are now ſpeaking of, which is mans ſelfe. When a man is ſwallowed up with ſelfe, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed up with God: whatſoever the creature is put upon, when ſwallowed up with God: this creature thus led forth out of ſelf-love, will reſemble the ſame, if not goe beyond it: nothing that ſtands in the way of the Creature thus poſſeſſed, is too deare to it, or too hard to attempt it. Put <hi>Jehu</hi> upon pulling down Idols, it made him very zealous, it made the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees give almes, and ſpend themſelves, and ſuffer theirs to be ſpent, to attain their ends: It will put a man upon faſting much, praying often; yea if it be to hazard life or liberty, it is free, if it may but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh its owne ends: which is moſt commonly from a convicted happineſſe or glory, either inward from God, or outward from man: Self ſees a promiſe of life and happineſſe handed out in the Law to thoſe that keep it: as namely, Doe this and live: it never conſiders what it could doe, and now can doe: but now it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to try what may be done that an undone ſoule
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:174689:14"/> may be made happy: Oh the conſideration of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth ſo affect a ſoule tonvinced of the want of it; that as the love of God enjoyed, doth draw out that ſoule that enjoyes it too make for God: ſo this ſoule poſſeſſed with the love of ſelfe, doth draw out the Creature; not out of himſelfe, yet to do or act any thing, that may procure happineſſe to it ſelfe: Alſo ſelf-love in this particular, would not freely have all from God, nor would it be beholding to God for all: then it ſhould have nothing to glory in but God: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thoſe cryings out: Muſt the Creature do nothing; muſt he not take paines with his own heart to prepare it for God? Muſt not the creature ſeek, and knock, and pray, and be prepared for Chriſt? Not conſidering it muſt be a meer paſſive; Goe through the ſufferings of Chriſt, or rather to have fellowſhip with him in his ſufferings: that is, to be ſubject to the will of God, and to ſuffer God to diſpoſe, order, or burne up in the Creatures ſpirits as he pleaſeth; onely the ſoul to be a patient in the workings out of life, untill he can act from the enjoyments of it: The Lords way is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, or burne up all the creatures preparations for God, and all that ſtuffe the creature hath within him, or attained by him; and ſtrips the Creature naked of all, either in him or done by him, and brings him as an empty ſoul to him who is the Fountain of life; and to be revealed in him. Now to take away an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is, that the Creature muſt labour, though not for life, yet for a manifeſtation of life. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; that the life whereby man acts to God, is by the power of life revealed from God; for before it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, man is dead; it is the revealing of life into man, which gives life to man: So that man can neither truly act for life, or the manifeſtation of it, before man be made alive by it, which is not before the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, which is life to the ſoul. Secondly, That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:174689:15"/> as mercy and love was prepared freely of God in Chriſt without the Creature, ſo it is to be revealed freely by Chriſt in the Creature, and after it be revealed in man, It is that grace which is in man, acts out from man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. That occaſioned theſe words from <hi>Paul, Yet not</hi> I, <hi>but the grace of God which was with mee,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. Then let theſe following particulars be conſidered of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That man who doth obey God, though his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be never ſo ſeemingly glorious; yet if he Reſt upon, and be ſatisfied with it, he Reſts below the true Reſt, which is God. For though the Creature yields obedience to the Law, or any other Truth, as the Truth requires: yet he is not to Reſt upon it, though it be of, and from the Lord it being flown from that which is to be the ſouls Reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſoul who being convinced of the want of, and its miſery without God; and from this labours to get God, by acting to God, though his action be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo glorious, it being to get his perſon acceptable, from the glory of his action, and Reſts here conceiving the acceptation of his perſon from the glory of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that mans Reſt and Conceptation is falſe.</p>
                  <p>This was the reaſon why <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and <hi>Cains</hi> was not, becauſe <hi>Abels</hi> perſon was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and <hi>Cains</hi> was not; for <hi>Cains</hi> action was as ſeemingly glorious as <hi>Abels</hi> was. But the acceptation of an <hi>action</hi> muſt flow from the acceptation of a perſon. It is not, nor cannot be, that any mans perſon can be accepted with God, from the glory of any of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures actings to God. Then it ſhould be of works, and man hath ſome thing to boaſt of. Neither is my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God a true evidence of my enjoyment of God, and acceptance with God. For the young man in the Goſpel, who was nigh to the Kingdome of God, did yeeld obedience to the commands of God; and yet he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174689:15"/> wanted that one thing neceſſary, which was to be the Reſt of his foul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Reſting upon any obedience to God performed in the exacteſt manner by the Creature, will bring nothing but death and ſorrow to the creature in due time: When a man kindles a fire, and Warmes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſparkes thereof: God upbraids the creature thus by telling him, his end ſhould be to <hi>lye downe in ſorrow.</hi> That is, When God comes to appeare upon any ſoul in love, he burns up all theſe falſe Reſts the creature hath been making for it ſelf. That is, What the creature drawes comfort from to himſelf, if it be from the glory of any action: that is, for a man to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fire, and warme himſelf in the ſparkes or fire he himſelf hath kindled Iſai. 50. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Now God at laſt brings the creature to ſee the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all his own actions; and upon this there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death to what he hath been living upon, and ſorrow annexed for his thus living upon it, and Reſting in it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore conſider; No acting forth of the creature to God, before the creature receive a divine power from God, is acceptable with God; for God accepts of no obedience, but either that which he did by Chriſt for us, or by Chriſt in us.</p>
                  <p>Now a man may doe great things by a power of Nature, Which I call a power of God in its diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Which power or from which power, a man acts in a way to God: that is, ſeemingly to God and for God; but in concluſion proves not ſo; now God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of no action by us, unleſſe it be from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of himſelfe in us.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing our actings to God are changable, and may ſeem to periſh though never ſo rare: It is no ſure Reſt for any ſoul: onely he who is unchangable in us, muſt be revealed to us, before any true Reſt can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:174689:16"/>
                  <p> Now the condition of a Soul in theſe low diſpenſations is like unto a man affrighted by an enemy, and being ſo he labours to preſerve himſelfe from death by him; he runs to ſecure himſelf; at laſt he findes to his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion a place of Reſt and ſafety, he being almoſt weary; afterwards it appears not ſo to be, but his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary purſues him, ſo that he is not ſafe; and ſo from place to place he runs to get ſhelter, he finding none, he is forced to yield himſelf up to the mercy of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, So it is with a Soul ſeeing God to be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he flyes as <hi>Adam</hi> did, thinking to ſecure himſelfe and cover himſelf; but God purſues the Soul and findes him out, where the Soule not finding any ſafe Reſt, yields himſelf freely with trembling and feare up unto God, to be at the mercy of God.</p>
                  <p>God (as I may ſay) purſues a Soule; and when it would be Reſting upon any thing below himſelfe, he drives it from its ſtation, and ſo man runs from Reſt to Reſt, and every Reſt he makes is more glorious then another: But God ſpeaks unto the Soule, as he did to the Apoſtles, <hi>Ariſe, let us go hence,</hi> John 14. 31. as if he ſhould ſay, You would be Reſting in this condition, but it is nor a condition of Reſt and ſafety, I will bring you higher, and that ſhall be when I will diſcover my ſelf in the Spirit, that you ſhall not Reſt upon my fleſh as I am in a ſhape; but upon me as I will be transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before you, or rather in you in the Spirit: So as now Ariſe, and go up, that is, higher. So alſo is God moſt commonly ſaying to ſuch Soules, <hi>Ariſe, this is not Yours Reſt,</hi> Mic 2. 10. if thou ſtay here it ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee <hi>with an utter deſtruction.</hi> Therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, This man runs from mountain to hill, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets his Reſting place, untill God hedgeth up his waies, and makes the ſoul at length Reſt in himſelf.</p>

                  <p>THe next Reſt of a Soul below the true Reſt is, The excellency of Gifts. which do ſo mightily adorne the Creature, as thereby the Creature is led into high conceits of the glory and excellency of its condition. The firſt part or Gift we ſhall ſpeak of is Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Multiplicity of Knowledge, is ſuch a rare Part, as makes a man ſeem much like a Saint: not carnall in the matters of the world, but ſpirituall, conceived in the matters of God: and this doth mightily puffe up the Creature. And indeed much knowledge attained in the notion, unleſſe it be experimentall, there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to keep the ſoul from Reſting in it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puft up with it, And.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all I ſhall diſcover, how moſt commonly the Soul attains this. The firſt is, from a quick appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in the underſtanding of things, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gift in nature; which is a ready way to attaine much knowledge, together with an enlaged capacity that he can receive and keep what he apprehends, ſo as he comes to gather in knowledge a pace into the notion; ſo as the Soule glorieth the moſt in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that gift or part in which he doth the moſt excel. This Creature he is very fluent in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the beſt things, and will be alwaies delighting moſt, in arguing of thoſe things that he hath the moſt knowledge in: and he being very gallant in diſcourſe, gathers knowledge in every thing he undertakes; and here he glories to overcome any with argument. Or.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To be adored, or had in high eſtimation for this his knowledge. And this applauding of him, makes his eſtimation of the glory of his own condition to be heightened; &amp; here he looks upon himſelfe to be a Saint in glory, he having theſe parts of knowledge, makes him as often argue againſt truth as for it, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:174689:17"/> others may ſee the wit and knowledge he hath; &amp; by ſtrength of wit be able to ſpeak of higher things, then thoſe who ſweetly enjoy God: Yea, for parts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge goes beyond, &amp; by all is preferred before them: Now having thus attained knowledge in the head though he doe not experience the ſame, he Reſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Knowledge which man Reſts upon, is a knowledge got by paines &amp; diligence of things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. That which is got by much paines, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more apt to Reſt upon: ſo as for the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary knowledge of the Scripture he exceeds. He is mightily fluent in the letter, and is able to ſpeak much from the ſame; and this doth furniſh him ſo, as now he makes it his glory to ſpeak of, and know much of the letter, though it is without him, and not experienced in him. But alas, what is it for any man to know much in this nature, and there Reſt. This is but the ſhell of Truth; the Subſtance is, Truth in us, experienced by us.</p>
                  <p>To reade Truth in the letter without me and to know it there, is a diſpenſation; but to know it by the Spirit within me, muſt be a higher diſpenſation, and the Diſpenſation of Reſt. For what is it for any man to get all the Scriptures into memory to furniſh him with knowledge, able to diſpute or preach; yet unleſſe he know the ſame within himſelf, it's but a poor Reſt: yet thus it is, men by a bundance of paines and diligence in the Scriptures and in books, doe get abundance of knowledge, and after it is gotten, they Reſt upon the ſame; as though it were to enjoy the manifeſtation of God, to enjoy much knowledge: here they abuſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God, and transform it into another uſe then ever God ordained it for: So that though a man have never ſo much knowledge, yea though his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be according to, or attained in the Scriptures, if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:174689:17"/> he Reſt there, before he hath got it in the heart by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſence; as he hath got it in the head for diſcourſe, his Reſt is much below the ſubſtance of Truth. For no man is to Reſt in any thing without him ſo known, untill it be within him; and then he Reſts not in God becauſe declared in Scripture; but upon God becauſe revealed and experienced in him, and ſo is fully known by him.</p>
                  <p>The third way whereby this Knowledge comes to be attained is, from the declarings of the experiences of others; he by the ſame ſtores himſelf with points of experience, as well as points of Judgement: and here he can ſpeak all manner of Languages, as well as thoſe that enjoy truth in them; ſo that he can ſpeak of points of judgement with thoſe that are for that diſcourſe, and points of experience, with thoſe that are for that, having a form of both in his underſtanding, and from that is able to make out himſelf, as thoſe who ſweetly in the power of Truth enjoy God: But for this latter, he hath but ſtolne the word from his Neighbour; hee hath got his experience to diſcourſe of. And this is the great deceit of mens ſpirits in our daies: for when they hear of a precious high Truth of God which they never heard of before, they either oppoſe it, or elſe they get the form of it into their notion or underſtanding, and the next upportunity they have, they declare it as their own: whereas though they were convinced of the truth of it, yet they were to waite for the enjoyment of the power of it in themſelves; and that it might be ſealed by the Spirit in them (1 Cor. 4. 19, 20.) But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conceive, if they can but remember a truth, though they have it not in the power of it in themſelves, that the very believing of it and aſſenting to it, is the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it: Bud theſe are thoſe who have a form of God, or the truth in their underſtandings, and want the power of that truth in their Spirits. And ſo many
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:174689:18"/> a ſoul reſts in this very part of knowledge. Now the Reaſons of a ſouls reſting here, are partly theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From a compariſon made in his own ſpirit with others that are in lower diſpenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon followes, from the high eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion others have of him; eſpecially men of the rareſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and ſolideſt judgements; and this addes fuel to his fire of conceipt, and makes his reſt the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And this is the reaſon that if at any time the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of thoſe—ceaſe to be what it was—that it occaſions much diſtraction and want of peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe: for when part of a mans cauſe of reſt and peace is taken away, no marvel then if part of his reſt and peace go along with it. Whereas he that reſts in God, is freed in the Spirit, and is as <hi>Mount Zion which can not be moved:</hi> Pſalm 125. 2. Let mans apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ceaſe, or encreaſe, he is not lifted up by the one, or caſt down by the other; but he hath a continuall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony within himſelf, which abides for ever.</p>
                  <p>The third Cauſe or reaſon of his reſting upon the gifts of knowledge, is from want of a right inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rmation of judgement, in the difference betwixt a form of truth in the underſtanding, and the power of truth in the heart, not oppoſite to the other: for though mans knowing God in generall or from hereſay, be a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>tion of God, and good in its place, yet it is not to be reſted upon, as though the ſoul had in this a reall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:174689:18"/> enjoyment of God. Now a man may know a thing in generall, and may believe in it, aſſent to it and obey it, and make a large profeſſion of it: yet if he enjoy not God in that very thing, it is but a diſpenſation below the power of Truth. So that we ſee here, that men may get things into the head, before they be in the life and power of them in the heart, which if reſted upon, brings with it a dangerous conſequence. As</p>
                  <p>1. It is the way to high ſecurity, and ſuch a ſecurity, being but carnall, as being without ground. It is the way in the ſecond place, to a ſelf-glorying and creature exalting, and to the diſpleaſing of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is the way to fall into all manner of looſneſſe, under pretence of freedome and knowledge of truth; and that is no ſinne, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t do this or that: For no marvel when a man hath no more then a form of God in the head, and wants the power of God in the heart, then that ſoul fals into a carnal looſneſſe, whereby truth is evil ſpoken of; and the party thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtifying his action by his hardneſſe of ſpirit, which by it he is brought into. And this is the reaſon why many when they have received high notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and do hold them forth, do walk very unlike truth, is becauſe they have it but in the head, and want the power of it in the heart. They have it from others, or ſome other way and not from God; and ſo they cannot ſtand in the day of temptation, and ſo return <hi>like a Sowe to the wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 22.</p>
                  <p>Again a Soul is further eſtabliſhed in this condition from his dayly growth and encreaſe in knowledge; he dayly growing in knowledge, daily more eſtabliſhed on his own bottomes, though not ſo thought by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This dayly encreaſe of knowldge in himſelf, the benefit that ſometimes is redounded to others, by that doth increaſe the flame, and ads fuel to the fire of this falſe reſt.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:174689:19"/>
                  <p> The ſecond excellent Part or Gift upon which men Reſt is, Prayer: and this is made an Idol of by ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who Reſt upon it. But firſt of all when a man ſets his face towards God, it would gladly pray, but want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this proper Gift, it uſeth formes; but after it ſees the vanity of that diſpenſation and the emptines of it, it now would gladly pray in the ſpirit; and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is complaining for want of matter to expreſſe; In concluſion it attains matter to expreſſe, and in the attaining matter doth much abuſe the ſame: but the meanes moſt commonly wherein it doth attaine it is, firſt, by often freequenting private and publike meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings where it ſteales away the expreſſions of others; and when it ſees one man enlarged, it is made to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that part in them and cry out, O if I could pray as ſuch a one can, then I ſhould be at reſt, and enjoy much peace. It preſſes forwards and by pains and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, it attains that enlargement, as that now it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels others, and is now admired by them, who before was admired by it; ſo as now the poor Creature can ſpeake three or four hours in prayer; and can hardly comprehend himſelfe within the ſpace of one houre; and here lys the deceipt of the heart, that here the Soul makes his reſt; and this to be a ſure evidence of his intereſt in God. But alas, how blinde and unſound this preſent evidence is, let Scripture and experience teſtify: for alas, a hypocrite, or one who at all knows not God, may excell in the ſeeming glory of this part, yea, excell thoſe that live in the higheſt enjoyments of God: and here many ſouls maks this diſpenſation a meer Idol, they draw all their peace and comfort from it: for if in this part the Creature excell, he will be the ofner uſing of it, living moſt upon it: draw moſt comfort from it, and glory the moſt in it: for if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the creature be ſtraitned in this particular, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to droop and be ſad, and full of trouble: but if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:174689:19"/> either in publique or private he be enlarged much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he is mightilly refreſhed and lifted up.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, If at any time he cannot have thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opportunities or ſet times, then all his peace is gone; and it is becauſe his peace is grounded upon his often praying and his great enlargement in ſo doing, and indeed the ſouls blindneſſe lies here: for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture takes his inlargement to be a manifeſtation, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the preſence of God. Now a man may pray long and often, and excell all in externall form, and yet have none of the preſence of God manifeſted at all in the ſame: neither is a ſtraightning of the Creature in expreſſion, to be any cauſe of ſorrow or trouble, if God be maniſeſt: neither is it an evidence of his not being manifeſted within. So here party <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the ground of a ſouls thus Reſting, or taking ſatisfaction of peace to his ſpirit, in this diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>Now I would not be miſtaken, that I am ſpeaking againſt this form or diſpenſation; when a man is not commanded by the form, but he is commanded from a power within, ſo as he commands it, and uſeth the ſame according to the end for which it was appointed. For I look upon the ſame as to be a diſpenſation of God: But I looke upon the reſting in it, or having peace by it, to be a corruption of a mans own heart, and a deceit thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. Therefore I commend theſe things following to be conſidered of all.</p>
                  <p>That though a man ſhould be never ſo glorious, or admirable in this particular diſpenſation, ſo as in the ſame he may be able to ſpeake a whole day together, yet his heart in this may deceive him, and if it doe not, yet it is no ſafe Reſt, or cauſe of peace, or ſatisfaction; for there is no ſafety in the excellents Part, that can be received, but they take their wings and flie away; and there is not that in them, which men conceive.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:174689:20"/>
                  <p> Secondly, Man may have theſe parts in the glory of them, and yet have no fellowſhip or communion with God in them: and ſo they may be rather ſnares then ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re reſts: Nay, if it were ſo, as many ſouls doth enjoy God in them, or rather communion with God in the ſame, yet it is neither the duty, or enlargement which is or ought to be the reſt: but God made manifeſt in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The third part of Gift is, Humility. And this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times comes ſome of theſe waies following.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Either from an inſtinct or property in nature. Or</item>
                     <item>2. From a ſelf-reaſoning. Or</item>
                     <item>3. From reſembling the truth of Humility, that is in another. Or</item>
                     <item>4. From, or as an effect of the enjoyment of God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, it is in many, who in the leaſt have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine workings of God in them, any way made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: yet they are excellent in this very particular; which makes them very lovely in the eyes of all men; ſo that a little of God will be ſeen in ſuch a creature; but meerly without the manifeſtation of grace: ſuch a Soule doth appear to be gracious; ſuch a ſpirit as this is can hardly be given to paſſion; but full of meekneſſe, and love, and moderation: and yet this parties gifts are common or naturall to him. He cannot be almoſt otherwiſe, this diſpoſition is ſo naturall. But others by nature are of a turbulent ſpirit and full of pride and choller, which makes him to become odious to all: and hereupon when he becomes odious to himſelfe; he fals in the ſecond place to reaſon thus. O how love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe others appear to me! how humble and lowly are they! What a proud ſpirit am I of! How am I hated and become almoſt odious to all! I will go ſee if I can help this carriage of mine. Now this Soul onely looks to take away the effects, though the cauſe abide:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:174689:20"/> and here he labours to frame his ſpeeches, and his je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and actions and ſo by much pains gets a form of humility; and now carries himſelf very ſweetly towards all, ſo that now there is a ſtrong change wrought in this perſon, ſo that he is admired by all, and chiefly by himſelf; who was of ſuch a high carriage, and of a proud and turbulent ſpirit, and now he is of a calm and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſpirit; this appears to be a great change, and ſo judging of it, he is highly exalted in his opinion of himſelf, and conceives he hath enjoyed abundance of grace from God, that hath thus humbled him: when indeed he hath it but in the forme of it, not in the power: having the branches and effects taken a way for the preſent in the outward expreſſion of it, but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into another ſhape, and that is more inwarde, making of him more ſpiritually proud, and ſo have high conceits of the happineſſe of his condition, and ſo Reſts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It reaſons thus, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. Now in his high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of carriage, or turbulency of ſpirit, he looks upon his condition as to be reſiſted of God; whereupon he prayes and uſeth what meanes he can to reſtraine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſaith he, It may be I may come to get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a better temper of ſpirit, whereby I many not become both odious to God and man, Now I ſay at laſt, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a form or ſhape of what he doth deſire, and Reſts ſatisfied in the receiving of it. Though I ſay, he is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly but transformed into another likeneſſe, the cauſe yet remaining, which of the two conſider the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that follow, as namely, Security, or luke warmnes; or fulneſſe and ſelf conceitedneſſe; and ſo falſe Reſtings are of as dangerous a conſequence as the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Humility is by reſembling of ſuch proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of words and actions in an other, as is moſt lovely in the eyes of himſelf and others, and here lies a ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:174689:21"/> when men doe only reſemble the words or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of another, which it may be in that party flowes from a principle or power of God in him; and by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of him, and getting into his form, think their condition is the happier, and ſo glory in it more then before: ſo that though his Humility flow from a divine work in him; yet the others is but ſhaped out of what is expreſſed, by or from him: and here lies much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, eſpecially if man Reſt in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The forth way whereby humility comes moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be attained. And the way indeed, is from the enjoyment of God, thereby man comes not only to have the effects or branches cut off, but the cauſe or root of the ſame taken away. So as now man hath it not in the form or ſhape, but in power and ſubſtance: and now man is truly what he ſeems to be, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: whereby as the Creature is humbled, ſo God is exalted: and this is the Creatures joy, though not his Reſt wholly: This humility now is the effect of God enjoyed, whereby man is made to partake of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true; and this nature breaks out into theſe particular effects: but now this very effects of humility, though it be from the enjoyment of God, yet it is not the Reſt of a Saint; but the cauſe, which is God.</p>
                  <p>The next part is the gift of Utterance, which is that many have that knows not God; and many have not, which ſweetly enjoy him. So that man who is freely carried forth to utter or make known any thing he conceives is truth; yet there is neither cauſe of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, or Reſting in it; neither is there cauſe why a Soul ſhould the more glory in the enjoyment of it, or be troubled in the want of it.</p>
                  <p>The laſt part or Gift we ſhall ſpeak of is, Memory, This part of Memory, is that which doth moſt ſweetly adorn man in the viſible making of it forth; and it makes man much adored for it, it is.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:174689:21"/>
                  <p> 1. Away to grow very profitable in reſpect of him that hath it; and beneficiall to them for whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes it: as namely, In that diſpenſation of hearing, after which the party which enjoyes this Part, is able to repeat or declare almoſt <hi>verbatim</hi> what he hath heard; this makes him very profitable in what he hears, in reſpect of gathering knowledge: and benificiall to others from the improvement of the ſame. This is the reaſon why two Miniſters ſo profeſſing of themſelves, ſtudying their matter, the one brings it in a peece of paper, and the other in the ſame method or forme, though in his underſtanding; becauſ the one excels the otther in this Part of Memory; and this makes the one more eſteemed then the other, and the one to appear more weake then the other. But alas, though all theſe were in one man, in a higher ſtrain then I have declared; yet they all were but a poor Reſt, or cauſe of joy or contentment to any heart: and truly when God appears ſo as to manifeſt himſelf, the Soul ſhall ſee the weakneſſe and foolly of his ſpirit, to be ſatisfied in the whole: not to be any cauſe of Reſt, though they were diſpenſations of God, and were freely given by God. For all theſe may be in a very hipocrite, or in a meer naturall man.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all to conclude this Reſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is an abuſe of a Gift, and an affornt put upon the Giver, to make it either cauſe of Reſt, or an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a true enjoyment of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſoul moſt commonly, who is not led in the Spirit, either to behold God or enjoy him, to be the Reſts of ſpirits, is moſt uſuall—&amp; it can hardly be prevented, to Reſt upon ſuch Reſts as we have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but conſider that muſt be the Reſt of any who ſees or enjoys not one manifeſted to him to be above it. Man muſt have ſome Reſt, either true or falſe: But that muſt be the ſafe Reſt, the which no hipocrite doth at

Or why ſhould we make that the ground of our happineſſe, which is but a tallent given to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; which may be taken away at the Owners pleaſure; being given onely to bee improved, and then mans Reſt and peace ceaſeth: and in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he folly of mans heart appear, in abuſing the end of every diſpenſation, as of this of Parts; As.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The abuſe of Parts lyes in the boaſting and glorying in the gift, and not in him that gives it; And alſo in this, to make them his Reſt.</p>
                  <p>2. For a man ſo to glory in them, as to make a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gain of them, &amp; improve in them for to get honour and preferment, and glory in the World. This I fear was partly the end of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in deſiring the gifts of God. Alas all gifts are empty without God be Manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; and poore contentment do they afford, to him that Reſts in them. And here men are ſetting them in Gods place, and labouring to diſpoſſeſſe God, who is or ought to be the ſatisfaction of the heart; And this is another abuſe of Parts; A world of deceit lyes in mans heart about gifts or parts if abuſed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They will not make forth themſelves, unleſſe it be where they be honoured, or elſe they labour for the ſame by the improvement of them, being the moſt free where it's the moſt applauded; and the moſt ſtraitned and wary of that place where it is not ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and exalted, and ſet up above the proper ſtation of the creature; being much cheered when exalted, and much caſt downe when rejected, or at leaſt not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded as he requires or expect; here is man much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing Parts and ſetting them in Gods ſtead; in the which man ſhall be brought to a loſſe when.

                  <p>THe next Reſt in order to this, is Zeal for the truth. Zeal in the matters of God is that which the moſt go through, before the manifeſtations of God: yet though it be good in its place, and a diſpenſation to be owned, yet it is but a deceitfull Reſt. We know the cry of him in the Scripture, who was Reſting and glorying in his Zeal for God; when he cryed, come ſee my Zeal for the Lord of hoſts. So we know many mens Zeal goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their knowledge of God in the ſpirit. We hear of a zealous <hi>Saul</hi> who was mad of Zeal in perſecuting the Church, Act. 22. 3 and out of conceit he did God good ſervice, Reſted ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>We know the Scribes and Phariſees who were the moſt zealous for Sabbaths, and prayer, and other points of Worſhip; yet they make it their Reſt: but come to our daies, and ſee if we ſwarme not of the ſame, only ſeeming profeſſors of God, who are very zealous for the ſame things; and from their very zeal, are made to Reſt with high thoughts of their condition. But how far this zeal (which is moſt commonly led with more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then Judgement) will bring man into a form of Truth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It will leade man into a whole conformity to what it doth conceive to be truth; that it ſhall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what it hath, ſerve God in all good conſcience; Acts. 23. 1. and according to the Law, to be unblamable and untaxable: Then his converſation ſhall bee very ſtrict in the obſervation of what the Law requires, and he ſhall act the ſame with much vehemency of ſpirit, taking all oppertunities for the doing of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It will carry the ſoule on to ſuffer cheerfully what he may meet withall in this very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</p>

                  <p> Thirdly he may by zeal afflict his body ſore, 1. Cor. 13. 3. with faſting and mourning, under pretence, the one to honour and obey God; the other for diſhonou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Zeal come to Goſpel precepts, and may be Zealous for that light in externall formes which is there required to be obeyed; ſo as he may gather Churches, and may ſuffer much, in the conforming to, and practiſing with ſo much vehemency, the Ordinances co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly practiſed by the Churches, in the Apoſtles and our daies: ſo as his Zeal may lead him out to teaching and helping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that work, ſtudying night and day to finde out matter to furniſh himſelf for edification: ſo as for paines in the Churches, and for Zeal to obſerve the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of thoſe formes, and any thing required to bee practiſed in the ſaid Churches; ſo as now it will have communion in Ordinances, with none but thoſe of his own ſtamp &amp; judgement; being mightily carried forth to judge and pitty thoſe, who are oppoſers of that light: Now this ſoul through Zeal may goe thus farre, yea, to act the very higheſt things the Scriptures doe require in matters of viſible practiſe, and yet be not at all taught in the Spirit, neither got into the life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of what he doth profeſſe; but meerly zealous for ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and wants the power; ſo as he is commanded by the form, and not the forme by the power dwelling within him. Now grant farther, That ſuch a ſoul did act in truth according to this diſpenſation, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in this particular, there were no cauſe of Reſt, for nothing viſibly ſeen, flowing from the Creature, ought to be its Reſt; but ſome viſible flowings into the Creature, which is being and ſubſtance from which and unto which, a Soule through Zeal for God acts; Alſo a Creature thus Zealous, Reſts not at home; but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:174689:23"/> reformes abroad alſo, beginning with his own family, and ſo goes abroad to others. and labours for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and practiſes the ſame with much Zeal, ſo as he can not endure the viſible appearance of any ſinne in himſelf or others. He may help with much Zeal the purging of Cities and Nations, or drunkenneſſe or ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or any open prophaneſſe: he may be for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evil doers in this particular with much ſeverity, and ſeeming to be much troubled at the neglect of it; he may rejoyce much in this practiſe, and may help forward this work in a Nation very much. and yet this no Reſt at all: alſo he may be zealous, yea, mad of Zeale for the worſhip of his God in reference unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not only taking all opportunities to inform them in the ſame, but uſing all Coercive powers for confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them thereunto; ſo as he may be an inſtrument to bring families and moſt part of Cities into this outward conformity to the matters of worſhip; and here hee lookes upon an action done of great moment and weight, and partly makes this an evidence of this true enjoyment of God, by Reaſon of his Zeale for God, and the effect thereby produced, which is the good of many. Now the cauſe of a Souls thus Reſting, partly flowes from want of the information in judgement, of the great deceite of the heart, in putting man by zeal upon ſuch publique actions, and then to cauſe it to Reſt: and further, it conceiving it's Zeale for God, and from a principle of God; not being acquainted with a Phariſaicall Zeale, <hi>to be ſeen of men,</hi> or to get a name amongſt men; or that Zeal which men have but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge; or the Zeale <hi>Paul</hi> had before converſion, which excels both: for vehemency and downrightneſſe, is the Zeal of many a profeſſor, who are at Reſt in our daies.</p>
                  <p>Now a poor Creature becauſe he is made to ſuffer freely, and to hazard life and liberty in the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:174689:24"/> of this Zeal, he is much puffed up under theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 That this is a parting with all for Chriſt, and a great point of ſelf denial, and ſo an evidence of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt; when indeed the Soule is in himſelf, and hath not at all attained that eſtate to forſake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Therefore let every heart, though never ſo Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for God, take notice, that his heart may deceive him in his Zeal, and his affection may blinde his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo it proves blinde zeal.

                  <p>Secondly, Conſider, that though it be ſuch Zeale as is good and to be approved of in its diſpenſation, yet not at all to be Reſted upon, nor to be an evidence of any true enjoyment of God, though he pretend God in the fore-front as <hi>Jehu</hi> did.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:174689:24"/>
                  <p> But firſt, let us conſider, that true holineſſe of a perſon, made manifeſt in actions, flowes from the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of a Soule made manifeſt in the Spirit; ſo that the trueſt holineſſe, or outward ſanctification, doth wholly flow as an effect of Juſtification made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: As for inſtance, The fountain and the ſtreames: The ſtreames are an effect of the Fountain, flowing from the abundance contained in the ſame; ſo it is with God made manifeſt in the heart, he being the Ocean or Fountain comprehending all ſtreames within himſelf; doth iſſue out of himſelfe thoſe ſtreames of Sanctification or holineſſe in converſation from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus abiding in the Creature. So that a man may have the latter in as high manner, though not in truth, as he that hath God truly manifeſt; and no way to be diſcerned but by the light of truth dwelling within, which makes the truth or falſhood of ſuch things in this nature manifeſt; and before the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, the Creature is in darkneſſe, and it is as poſſible for a man to ſee twenty miles in a very darke night, as for a man really to judge of the truth or falſhood of his own condition before this light come in from God, which expels thoſe clouds, as the ſhining of the Sun doth the clouds; and here lies the darkneſſe of a heart when it is made to ſee the want of God, it looks into the frame and diſpoſition of mens ſpirits abroad, who are under a name of profeſſion, and being much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and drawn out in love to them, it gets into ſuch relations or ſociety; and it ſees abundance of holineſſe flow from their converſations; now it being away to reprove that party, not having the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in holineſſe of walking, or power againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it cries out, O that I were ſo holy in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as ſuch a one is! O that I had ſuch and ſuch a power againſt corruption as they have! And could be alwaies diſcovering of good things as they are; or could
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:174689:25"/> have my minde fixed upon heavenly things as they have. O how heavenly doth ſuch a one walke: and this is his conſtruction or application; O if I could be but ſo, I ſhould then be at peace and Reſt; then I ſhould think my condition happy; but alas here is ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of carnall mindedneſſe, and of corruption in my converſation; and a wearineſſe in things that are good; here the creature takes up a daily complaint, and to every Saint is making his condition known, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt quiet, untill he have reſembled or attained ſuch a meaſure of knowledge to diſcourſe of God, and ſo much power againſt corruption, as to walke in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation like thoſe, whoſe converſation did convict him and ſhame him.</p>
                  <p>Now having attained ſo much in ſhew, and that now his affections ſeem to be bent upon good things; that now God is his meditation and his continuall ponder: that now when its thus, the creature hath much peace, ſometimes upon the view of the ſame: and when it cannot walke thus, it hath neither Peace not reſt. Now here the creatures heart deceives him, and makes him reſt upon that which may be in truth, and not in truth, or upon that which is given to change, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides not one and the ſame for ever. Now all this a man may have, and yet have nothing manifeſt in truth: and though it might be ſaid, thar theſe are true in there place, yet not appointed for reſts: but for effects of that which was in truth within: for he that ſaith, he dwels in him, <hi>ought even ſo to walk as he hath walked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now holineſſe in the higheſt degree as it flowes out from man, is but an eſpecial effect of the dwelling of the ſpirit of God, or an effect of his reſt in him; not to be a reſt, but to manifeſt to others, that he dwels and reſts in God. For to me, that Soule who reſts and dwels in God, muſt have his converſation, but eſpecially, his inward walking like God; for to others
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:174689:25"/> that look upon a Saint thus pretending to dwell, muſt judge of the ſame by that fruit that flowes from him in one kinde or another: though it is not to be a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to himſelf, who thus liveth; he having another teſtimony which ſpeaks, or evidences peace (1 John 5. 10.) upon more ſure grounds; yea and lets the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſee a ground or place of reſt, going as farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, as the ſtreames are ſhort of the Fountaine, and the body of the Sun beyond the leaſt glimpſe or ſhining thereof. Man I may ſay, who is reſting in peace and quietneſſe of ſpirit from theſe viſible branches, if they be true, is one who ſtill hangeth upon the outſide of the Arke; and like the Phariſees, reſting with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious outſides, and waſhing of the outſides of Cups, more to be ſeen of men, or juſtified before men, then to be as an effect of that truth within, made forth for the glory of God. The one of theſe ends did <hi>Cain</hi> act for, and the other end did the Scribes and Phariſees act for; ſo that a houſe built upon ſuch a foundation as this, ſeems to be as glorious as that which was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Rock, but it was not ſo ſafe; for with every blaſt and ſtorm that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es againſt ſuch a ſpirit it fals into its former ſtate it was in before thus builded; ſo were the devout Women, and golden Sepulchers, and whited walls, builded upon ſuch conſiderations as theſe, they were outwardly holy, and ſeemingly pure; but were within full of deadly poyſon, and were put for outward glory, not adorned with the Spirit; ſo it is very likely that the ſaid ſpirit, that Reſts upon this ſeeming, though thought by himſelf true holineſſe; is a ſoul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together full of deadly poyſon and deceite, which in time may be diſcovered, and then the Creature ſhall ſee another reſt more ſure and ſafe then this, and ſhall loſe by it, yet Love ſhall ſave him, though it be a fire for to burn up what of this reſt was of himſelf: ſo that I ſay ſuch a ſoules foundation of reſt, ſhall fade as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in all his glory.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:174689:26"/>
                  <p> Firſt, Then this Spirit thus reſting, is away to keep it below true aſſurance; for in this reſt there can flow no true cauſe or ground to the Creatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e to be aſſured thereby.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For a man to reſt here, it will be but to make a houſe, which ere long it may be God will bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about his ears; and ſo prove labour in vaine, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can ſpeak by ſad experience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whatſoever flowes from a man pretended to God, before there be an inward revelation in that man of God, and makes the ſame a true evidence of his enjoying this God thus revealed, and ſo reſts: his thus doing is but his own righteouſneſſe, and not the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt revealed by faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the party thus acting, doth go no farther then a point of bodily exerciſe; for what a man doth in point of holyneſſe, pretending for God, and after doth own it as a true evidence, or any cauſe of reſt, as God. To me it appears, and in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scriptures; that mans action is but bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: for nothing is, or ought to be, either reſt, or evidence of the true enjoyment of God in me; which is any way done by, or acted from me; but ſomething in the which I am a paſſive, and no active; in which muſt be ſomething of God, coming in from God, which doth give a teſtimony of truth to me, and reveales the true reſt in me: And if I reſt otherwiſe, my reſt is not that which I take it to be. So that it's alone the power or glory of ſomething coming to me, and not the actings of that to God from me; which is all the hearts reſt of a Saint.</p>
                  <p>But there lies ſo much deceit in the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9, 10. that the truth moſt be known, by undeniable teſtimony in man, before the makings of it forth, can in truth be diſcerned: but as I ſaid before, man lies in darkneſſe until there be ſomething in the ſoule which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:174689:26"/> is a cleare light, giving the creature to know truth from truths Teſtimony: for any action of deceit from the heart to God, as ſo pretended, will not be without reaſon and ground, yea, and Evidence proved to be true by the heart: but ſtill this Light, which is God within, is that which diſcovers man to himſelf; yea, the winding deceits in the heart, though never ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly acted by the heart.</p>

                  <p>The proud Phariſees did exceed in this, and many others who made it their Reſt, and bleſſed themſelves in ſo doing; and ſaid, they faſted ſo often, and wept ſo much, and were ſo and ſo afflicted; when indeed they lived upon it, and gloryed and Reſted in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>I know though it might be confeſſed, this is the way of God; yet it is not to be a Reſt to any man: For man is not able to judge of any Truth until the Light break in upon him; which makes all things manifeſt: and then ſhall man judge righteous judgement.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:174689:28"/> it to be a truth in Scripture, or from hearing it preached by others; or from the undeniableneſſe of the truth of it in it ſelf; he is made to aſſent unto it as a truth: and never matters, nor underſtands it muſt bee particularly witneſſed to be his truth, from the ſame Revealed within him: But he not underſtanding this, he ſees not only, the emptineſſe of mans doing, and the vanity of putting the creature to act to get Love or Life from God: And ſo that only, now all the creatures acting to God, muſt be from Gods acting in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo that now he is an enemy to that before he was a ſpeciall friend of, <hi>viz.</hi> his own righteouſneſſe: and that he is now gon as far in an extreame on the other hand, to Reſt ſatisfied only with a Notionary knowledge of this ſaid truth: Alſo he ſees in this that nothing but a Chriſt can, or will do good to ſpirits, and yet knows not this Chriſt within himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome times man only getting a Nation of this Truth in the head, comes in the end to much looſneſs and fleſhly walking, 2. Gal. 17. and can put it off with a very fair ſlight.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is free in his diſpenſation, man can doe nothing unleſſe power be given unto him: I did ſuch, and ſuch a particular, becauſe of the Woman; this is by reaſon of ſuch weakneſſe I am yoked withall: or if God did intend I ſhould not have committed theſe ſins he would have given me power againſt them, and I ſhal admire free grace the more; and I ſhall love the more the more is forgiven me. So though he hath no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of God at all for the pardon of ſin, yet he lives continually in this ſtream, believing free grace is a Truth: this is to have it manifeſt; when the creature ſinnes to believe it is freely pardoned upon the Croſs; when indeed now it ſleeps in ſecurity and looſneſſe: And the reaſon partly of its looſneſſe, and yet of its ſecurity is.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:174689:29"/>
                  <p> Firſt, he hath got but the light of it, that is to ſay, ſuch a light as doth diſcover a truth in this to him; yet he wants the life &amp; being of the thing made manifeſt. So it comes to paſſe he profeſſes this particular, yet he doth not poſſeſſe the ſame in the nature of it: ſo he hath a name that he liveth, and yet is dead: ſo that he hath it in the head, but wants it in the heart; he hath got a form of it in his underſtanding, whereby he can diſcourſe of it and declare it to others, yet he wants the power of this ſaid truth in the heart within him: and when a man hath the forme, figure, or likeneſſe of a thing, and wants the dower, glory, or being of the thing, no marvell then if a ſoul in a time of ſtraits, come to fall ſhort of what he doth profeſſe in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; he not being able to ſtand, wanting the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he ſhould be formed upon, and the power of the ſame which ſhould keepe him upon that being or foundation.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it may be he hath this truth taught him by man, and not from the teachings of God within: Now grace in the heart appearing, doth Teach man to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and Godly in this preſent world.</p>
                  <p>But there is a cunning deceit in the heart, that in ſome doth (if poſſible can be) prevent the ſame; and it reaſons thus, I ſee this Truth is ſpoken againſt by moſt, and that thoſe that are for Free-grace are ſuch men as walk very looſly; and as ſoon as ever they believe this that they are no more like the men they were before, but walke they care not how: but ſaith the ſoule that would make it a peaceable and honourble Reſt, leaſt they ſhould ſay ſo of me, I will walke a little more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they doe: And here before men he walks very like Truth, though there be a heart within him not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in what he doth; and partly it is to get a good name amongſt men; for ſuch as walk looſly that profeſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:174689:29"/> God, they are hardly eſteemed of any: the world hates them for their judgement; the other cannot favour them for their looſe practiſe: Here they will labour to apply a remedy to this diſeaſe, in reference to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that is the Saints: They will amongſt Saints I ſay, carry themſelves like them, and reſemble them in their practiſe; as the Magicians did <hi>Moſes:</hi> Yet this is not from a divine principle of love, but for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, or from another principle. Againe, Some walk like Truth, becauſe they make it a Teſtimony of Gods dwelling in them; for, ſaith the Scriptures, <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk even as he walked:</hi> 1 John 2 6. Now ſaith the creature, if I ſhould walk looſly it would appear to my ſelfe and all, That God dwelt not in me: but now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (and he thinks inward, though he be deceived) conformity to Truth I may make it an evidence of my dwelling in truth: and ſuch a man as this muſt needs curb himſelf of thoſe things tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> another ſwallows; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is his ground of peace and Reſt.</p>
                  <p>Again, A man may ſhun looſneſſe, that hath but the notions of free grace; becauſe it is the way to make Diſciples, and get the affections of men to applaude and admire what flowes from him, ſo as he is mightily eſteemed, yea, inſtrumental to diſpenſe thoſe truths that dwell not in him; ſo as it may be hee is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of begetting ſons like unto himſelfe; that is, to believe Free grace is a truth, and to be convinced of it, and diſpiſe working, which is oppoſite to it; and here they both ſit down and Reſt: Not knowing the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gods dealings with the creature, which is moſt commonly to enlighten or convince man of a truth, and ſet the heart a waiting for it, before hee gives him an enjoyment of it. As for inſtance, He firſt convinces man of a Divine fulneſſe in God, and a ſupply given from God to bee diſpenſed by Chriſt to the ſonnes of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:174689:30"/> men; wherupon the creatures ſpirit is ſet a waiting for it, and at laſt comes to enjoy it: So in Free grace when God repreſents this truth, to let man ſee he is Free in all his diſpenſations; man being thereby convinced of it, his heart is ſet a waiting for the enjoyment of the ſame within him, which he ſees in God above him; that is above his reach of enjoying; and ſo he doth not let him Reſt though he ſee a truth, until he comes to have the manifeſtation of it within him, and in the power and life of it, enjoyed by him.</p>
                  <p>So as the generall knowledge of Free grace, before it be known particularly in the Creature, by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it from God, will be no ſecure Reſt or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for any ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The creature in this condition may receive it with much joy, as witneſſe them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20. yet be ſhort of having the power.</p>
                  <p>This truth is very pleaſant to many, eſpecially to thoſe that have been the greateſt workers for Grace; whereupon their delight is much taken up either in hearing, reading, or diſcourſe that tendeth to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of this truth; and it is a diſpenſation of God in ſome men, but not a Reſt unto them.</p>
                  <p>Now men who are made to Reſt here, may have high notions of this truth; and may be more able to ſpeak of it, then thoſe who have enjoyed it, in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral manner: but come to the particular workings of it in the ſoul, and many prove ſhallow there; only they declare it as they ſee it, to be a Scripture truth; But he that Enjoyes, ſees it to be an Experimentall and a Scripture Truth. Now ſome men have learned what he beleeves, and Reſts upon it only from report; or men declaring their experiences, or what the Scripture doth relate of others; but have not any Teachings of God, what it ſaith (according to the Scriptures) in them by Experience: And here ſometimes, man is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:174689:30"/> not compleatly furniſhed to declare this Truth: But one who doth enjoy truth within, doth a little diſcerne where ſuch a ſoul is; to wit, have heard, and from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do declare; and yet not brought into the Kingdome of Truth, to ſee and experience it within himſelf. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Man may daily increaſe in the Notionary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Truth, wherein he may appear a Tall Cedar in his own eies and in the eyes of others; and grow up into high Notions and Light, and is able to ſpeak of very high and glorious light; yet if he here Reſt, it may prove in concluſion but a feeding upon winde and husks.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, In this knowledge of Truth may man ſolace and refreſh his ſpirits continually, in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the ſame: and yet it is but ſeeming, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſatisfaction or refreſhment; if he there Reſt truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, to be God himſelf, for want of information of the difference betwixt what is a Truth in it ſelf, ſeen ſo by me, and a Truth mine, manifeſted within me; not knowing the foot-ſteps of truth without man, from the foot-ſteps of truth within man: not knowing a difference betwixt the deceipt of the heart in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable workings, making glorious Reſts of that which is none; and Truth nakedly diſcovered from, or by God in the heart, with its End, and Teſtimony: ſo as the creature is not ſatisfied with any thing, though it be a truth, without him; until he finde the very being of that Truth within him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore whoſoever he bee that reads theſe few lines, Let him beware of theſe things following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that he judge not that to be a place of Reſt to his ſpirits, which is but in ſhew, not enjoyed in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; nor abſolutely paſſe ſentence of any thing, untill there be a Divine light within which makes it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: Yea, though they may come ſo far as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of truth of Free grace, and for the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:174689:31"/> Excellency of Chriſt in God; yet Reſt not until thou finde it in thy ſoul manifeſt from God; then ſhalt thou ſeal it to be a truth: yea, thou ſhalt have it ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up for Truths, by the Spirit of GOD within thee: Alſo to take notice, I do not deſpiſe, nor condemne this diſpenſation not to be of God, firſt to ſee by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures theſe to be Truths: But There labour to unbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and to un center any ſoul, who meerly reſts in the notion of them</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To beware of condemning theſe things, becauſe they have no experience of them; or becauſe they come nigh them; or becauſe if they be Truths, they have nothing left them; but wait untill they ſee a Light within, to diſcover the truth or fallacy of them to them; Jer. 17. 9. and if ſo be they ſee not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of their hearts, or thoſe falſe Reſts in them, we are ſpeaking of; yet do not condemn them, who have both ſeen and known them, as though they ſought to deſtroy the foundation of God in Saints; but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as one owning any diſpenſation of God, in its place proper to it.</p>

                  <head>The Eight falſe Reſt.</head>
                  <p>THE Next Reſt we deſire to ſpeake of, in order to this, is the Knowledge of Chriſt in the fleſh; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar conſidered, as he is declared in Types and Figures under the Law, or as he aſſumed nature upon him, and ſo conſequently dyed at Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Now for the firſt, In reference to Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which at this time are the diſpenſation of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, either practiſed before or ſince his Coming: How many in our daies are they that meerly reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch ſhadows, ſome practiſing of ſuch Types as held
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:174689:31"/> forth Chriſt to come; ſome in thoſe that were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed after his Coming; and here they ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As inſtance the cry of moſt, Wee enjoy the pure Ordinances of Chriſt; wee are members of the Church of Chriſt; we are partakers of thoſe outward priviledges purchaſed by Chriſt: Inſtance the peace and comfort they enjoy in them, the glorying and the high conceite they have of themſelves above others that do not practiſe with, or enjoy them; witneſſe their deadneſſe, flatneſſe when they want them, and their life and peace in the enjoying of them: witneſſe their binding up in them; and their whole Experience contained in this particular: When I was imployed in ſuch an Ordinance, I was fil'd with joy, or I was made to be ſatisfied with the ſeeing of God in it; when the poor Creatuer it may be, knowes not what God in all or any thing is; but if it be enlarged, or have ſome particular flaſhes of comfort, it makes that to bee the preſence of God; and meerly under theſe fleſhly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes or carnall relations do many Reſt ſatified.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, To Reſt upon Chriſt come in the fleſh, is to Reſt upon the beleeving the report the Scripture gives concerning him; as being <hi>born of a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin, and ſuffering, and being buried,</hi> and the like; and if they beleeve this, and can but heare enough of the Letter preached to this purpoſe, they Reſt; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſuch a particular to be true: and that is all that is required of them to ſalvation: and indeed ſo it is, and ſomething more.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, To Reſt upon Chriſt come in the fleſh, is to beleeve from the Letter of the Scripture, without any powerfull manifeſtation of the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> that this <hi>Chriſt</hi> who did according to Scripture dye at Ieruſalem, dyed for them: And here many ſatisfie themſelves, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high conceits of their condition; and here alone men Reſt upon the bare Figure. As if men under the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:174689:32"/> Law ſhould have made Circumciſion, and the enjoying of Sacrifices (in that common manner they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) to be a ground of Reſt; and ſo contented themſelves in the uſe thereof, as conceiving themſelves to be made happy, by the Type and Figure; and not by that which was Typified out in the ſame. So concerning Chriſts dying at Jeruſalem, it is a Figure of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall death of the creature with Chriſt; and alſo of this reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Now when we come to be buried with him, <hi>into his death, Rom.</hi> 6. 4. 5 and alſo come to be with him raiſed up from death, that is, into the clear enjoyments of God, where we are made to live in the God-hrad, from it living in us <hi>(Iohn</hi> 14. 17.) then do we fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know this Chriſt, and this eternal Life, and not meerly for a man to conceive, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e declare, that this Chriſt is come, and the Creature aſſenting to the whole hiſtory, and believing of it, that this is the knowledge of Chriſt, which is eternal life; for unleſſe the Creature know him ſo to be to him, <hi>that this eternal life to him.</hi> Col 3. 3. 4. that as the Scriptures do declare him ſo to be in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; ſo the creature findes it true within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from the experience of him in his own ſoul: his knowledge is but carnall, not living, ſpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; for that man that Reſts upon him, as he is declared in Scripture; before he be revealed within his ſoul: both that mans Reſt and knowledge is but carnall and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for we ſee that all men almoſt in <hi>England,</hi> or in any place where the Goſpel is but publiſhed, doe believe that he is crucified and is riſen; and this they know from the teſtimony of Scripture: but doth every man know the minde and myſtery of truth? Doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it to every one? Can any know the minde of God in theſe particulars, either by the Hiſtory or any other way; but by the Spirit of God? then it muſt he, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:174689:32"/> before this Chriſt come to be ſpiritually known, hee muſt be ſpiritually revealed within mans hearts (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.) So that to hear of Chriſt, and not to enjoy him, from being revealed within, is but very unſafe and unſound knowledge to Reſt upon, and that which brings not along with it eternal Life, as witneſſe, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1, 21 He clearly expreſſes, that this Chriſt which is eternall life, was made manifeſt unto them, and as their knowledge of, from which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they had fellowſhip and communion with him: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>This knowledge is ſpirituall, and according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpiritually revealed, before it be truly and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally known, now the Scriptures do not reveale Chriſt within any man, neither doe they ſay to any particular ſoule, thou ſuch a one, Chriſt died for thee: but it is the ſame ſpirit which did declare the Scriptures, which muſt reveal what this Chriſt is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what the miſtery of God in his ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or what myſtery God did hold out, in the figure which was his fleſhly coming too and for thee in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, Thou muſt doe as he did, <hi>paſſe from death to life;</hi> and from being buried with him, before thou live in the Kingdome of heaven with him, or indeed know what the Kingdome or place is, which men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conceive to be above the Skyes, though the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall knower of him knowes it in another place: Now what is it for a man to fill his head full of the hiſtory, concerning the birth and death of Chriſt. unleſſe this Jeſus a Saviour, or this Chriſt which is the light and glory of God, be diſcovered and revealed within him, ſuitable to that precious Teſtimony, of <hi>Pauls</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. where he ſpeaks of this Chriſt to be revealed within him: for Chriſt as he was in the fleſh, cannot be revealed; but Chriſt as he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:174689:33"/> is in the Spirit; or Chriſt as he is the great deſign of God, typified out in the fleſh, and revealed in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; either as a light, or as a life; or as he is the breath of God, or as he is the clear manifeſtation of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man comes to know him to be his Jeſus, that is, his Saviour, or inward deliverer; or wherein man cleatly beholds, <hi>the Father in him, and he in the Father, John</hi> 24. 11. Which cannot be diſcerned as he was in the fleſh; but as he is in the ſpirit; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. that being a figure thereof: we ſee this knowledge the Apoſtles wanted, when they ſaid, <hi>Lord ſhew us the Father: John</hi> 14. 8. they having no more knowledge of Chriſt, but as he was in the fleſh: they knew not that the Father was in him, and he in the Father: <hi>John</hi> 14. 11. upon this knowledge were they reſting, when they ſaid, <hi>Lord it is good for us to be here:</hi> Mat. 17. 4. when they would have been making Tabernacles of Reſt, before Chriſt did transfigure himſelf within; but Chriſt bids them, <hi>Ariſe let us goe hence,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, This is not a proper reſt for you; <hi>John</hi> 14. 31. It is a very low diſpenſation; goe, I will diſcover my glory to you by transfiguring my ſelf within you; then ſhall you ſee partly the myſtery of my ſelfe; then ſhall you more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually underſtand and know me.</p>
                  <p>And alſo ſometimes the carnall and fleſhly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the Apoſtles had then, put them upon carnal conceptions, as in theſe phraſes expreſſed, <hi>when wilt thou reſtore the Kingdome to Iſrael?</hi> And many more expreſſions; as deſiring fire might come from above; where Chriſt tels them, they <hi>knew not of what ſpirit they were:</hi> the one place tels them they looked upon him as to be one who was to have a great power in the World, namely, To be an earthly King, to live in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp and glory; the other doth ſignifie, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the great deſign of God in his coming: ſo as they in this diſpenſation were very low, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:174689:33"/> are in our daies; and would gladly have been reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the knowledge they had, which was Chriſt in the fleſh, that was known by them, and declared and preached by them alſo; but ſtill they remaining under the clouds, and ignorant of the myſtery of Chriſt, in reverence to his coming in the Spirit: yet God was daily leading them to behold their ignorance; and more into the myſtery of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>So that though men pretend to eſcape the common pollutions of the world, by ſuch a knowledge of Chriſt in the fleſh, yet it is not a ſecure eſtate; but a low diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which will diſſolve in a higher appearance of God. Therefore though men both know and beleeve that there was a Chriſt crucified in the fleſh, yet let them not reſt, untill they know it in the Spirit: Then ſhall a man ſee Chriſt daily crucified before his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For him.</p>
                  <p>And fourthly, Crucifying of him: That he ſhall ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> from experience, <hi>I am crucifyed with Chriſt; nevertheleſſe</hi> I <hi>live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Then ſhall the ſoul know both what it is to be crucified, by or with Chriſt, and alſo what this Chriſt is, that lives within him, which is become life unto him; then he ſhall know it is not fleſh, but Spirit and life that lives in him: neither ſhall he be ſatisfied with hearing of his death at Jeruſalem; but with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing partly the myſtery now made manifeſt in him, and ſo comes to be known by him; then ſhall he ſay, <hi>Though</hi> I <hi>have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth, know</hi> I <hi>him no more</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. Being he knowes him in the new Creation, being made to ſee and diſcern in the Spirit; and ſo behold Chriſt in the <hi>viſion of God</hi> Hab 2. 3.

                  <p>Thirdly, Never more pride and ſelf conceitedneſſe then at that preſent; ready to judge every one that were not in relation, in reference to Church-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be no Saints.</p>
                  <p>2. Looking more at the practiſe of Ordinances, and being members of Churches, then at the reall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch a ſoul.</p>
                  <p>3. More longing after the encreaſe of members, then of their living in the <hi>Spirit</hi> which were members.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:174689:35"/> they ſtand one from another; witneſſe their preaching and printing, and in the ſame their bitterneſſe; Inſtance their refuſal to hear or joyn one with another; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe their croſneſſe of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> what a ſmell of falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples this of Reſts appears withall; and truly argues much deceit, and unpoſſeſſed like with God.</p>
                  <p>If one either hath attained higher; or live in the uſe of Ordinances, waiting for the reall enjoyment of God, being lower; why ſhould that heart who hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoyed more or leſſe of God, have ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſſe of any thing of God in him: ſeeing God is love, and he that dwels in the loweſt enjoyment of God, dwels in Love: but truly the being bound to formes, or bound up in formes, and the uſing of them before we be led unto them by God, occaſions all this Reſting in, and condemning of all that do not in all things walk up into, and in the uſe of theſe formes and Church-relations, which the letter of the Scriptures owns to be a diſpenſation of God.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, As this is the cauſe of, and doth much ſavour to be occaſioned, either by our being bound up in them, or falſly led out to them: ſo alſo it is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the want of a divine principle within; whereby that principle of God might command our formes and Church-relations; and not formes and Church-relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons command the ſoul; ſo as the Soule onely ſeeing ſomething in the letter, wanting a divine light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to diſcover unto him, either the time, place, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or end; by this it comes to paſſe why he is darke in and Reſts upon, and is commanded by, and ſo bound up in the form required in the letter; being ignorant of truth in the <hi>Spirit:</hi> but to come more fully to the thing in hand: This, in my judgement was the Reſt of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, (Rev.</hi> 3. 17.) in her conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded riches; yea, in her inſenſible poverty: and thus it prevailes with many a heart.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:174689:36"/>
                  <p> Firſt, when eſpecially the Soul hath been much under the Law, and hampred by the Law, and ſo kept in a cloud from the view of Goſpel-truthes; and now come to ſee a clear truth in that which he ſo much oppoſed, he is ſo taken up with it, as he hath no peace untill he fals in obeying of it, &amp; ſo gathers peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Reſt in the ſame; thinking he is now got into a very high eſtate, and the very name of a member of a Church, together with the greatneſſe of the love of God in bringing this Creature to beleeve and obey, who was darke, oppoſite, yea a deſpiſer of the ſame: this doth help forward his Reſt in this particular.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It conſiders and reaſons with it ſelfe, now I am got into the communion of Saints, and enjoy now their ſociety; which before it wanted fellowſhip with; and alſo from conſideration of the purity of the Ordinances it now enjoyes.</p>
                  <p>It before was alive in the uſe of corrupted Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, now it enjoyes them in the purity of them; before in and amongſt a mixed people; he had <hi>fellowſhip with divels</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20.) now with Saints: but truly though this be a <hi>Laodicean</hi> condition, yet it is a falſe Reſt, for there is no true Reſt, either in the pureſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, or viſible relations, for theſe a man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and be ignorant of the enjoyment of God in them; as the wofull experience of many will ſeal unto, and teſtifle the truth of what we are ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another cauſe of Reſt in theſe relations, flowes from his continuall growth in Goſpel light, and his encreaſe and growth of knowledge; and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the whole bent of ſuch a ſpirit, is taken up with labouring after the knowledge of points of judgement, and with matters nice and curious, things which moſt commonly pleaſe the fancy and underſtanding? and to know ſuch things it is his continually ſtudy, and end of all his labour: when ſtill he wants the life and power
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:174689:36"/> of Chriſt in his heart; neither doth he know him, but either by his profeſſion or by hear ſaies; not in any true way of experience.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Another cauſe flowes from his conceived peace and comfort he enjoyes in the ſame: and thus he reaſons, before I had no peace, either in conſcience within me, or from O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dinances practiſed by me; but now I enjoy much peace in my condition; when indeed he may have ſtopt the mouth of conſcience, &amp; his peace come in from a falſe ground not ſpoken from God; but drawn forth or ſmagined in his particular practiſe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſoul feeds upon an imaginary peace, when it is ignorant of peace truly manifeſted in the heart: and in this moſt commonly doe the affections blinde and bribe the judgement, and ſo peace remaines onely in the imagination, and not enjoyed by any powerfull manifeſtation. But if mens hearts in Church-relations may ſo utterly be deceived, then it ſtands in need of theſe enſuing cautions. 1. Beware of making thy being a member of any Church; to be either evidence to thee, or ground of peace in thee: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any conceive better of their conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in viſible fellowſhips: and neither let their joy or peace be the more; unleſſe they do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly enjoy more of the diſcoveries of God to them then they did before.</p>
                  <p>2. Beware that thou thinke not thy outward uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a viſible manner with Saints, is an uniting thy <hi>ſpirit</hi> more unto God, or God uniting himſelfe more to thee: or that for or in thy preſent practiſe, thou art got higher to God; leſt thou Reſt more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in thy preſent condition then before: for carnall ſecurity doth moſt commonly follow the moſt of men in thoſe diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>3. Beware thou go no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> before God leade thee: for moſt commonly when God leads man into formes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:174689:37"/> when he forſakes them, he leades them out of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that diſpenſation God will appear in: therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that thou be not led by thy own imaginations; then thou ſhalt not be left in and bound up in formes, but ſhalt continue in them ſo long as God continues in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But many who live and make a God of their formes; they neither know when God leads or not leads; when God is preſent or not preſent, its all one if they can enjoy the deſire of their hearts, and that which ſpeaks peace to them, namely, Their formes and Churchre-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It is to them, yea, its life and happineſſe in them. But in the next place obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Though God do own all or the moſt formes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, yet it is but for a time, untill a higher diſpenſation appear, or the ſubſtance of that forme be enjoyed, and then God departs from it, and ſeldome or never appears in that forme any more; eſpecially if the ſoul be caught up into God: for as the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-formes, which were of Gods own appointment, and God was in them for the time they were to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo alſo they were to ceaſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When the ſubſtance thereof was come. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When a more glorious adminiſtration was and did appear; then did God both depart from them, and diſ-own them; an I they nowhere to be practiſed after theſe two did appear: So it is with new Teſtament formes, they have and had their time, and yet have when God will and doth appear in them; yet it is but untill God appear in a higher diſpenſation, and bring the ſoul into a higher adminiſtration; then do all ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and whatſoever is Goſpel-adminiſtration ceaſe to that particular ſoul, in the uſe of them what they were before, I would not be miſtaken, I doe not ſay they ceaſe to all and every perſon whatſoever; but to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:174689:37"/> ſuch a ſoul as is in this diſpenſation, namely, he who is caught up with God, and carried by God out of the forme; God ceaſing to appear to that particular ſoule in that forme: the Lamb leading the ſoul gently out of one diſpenſation into another, untill he be wholly ſwallowed up with God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such a ſoule as can truly ſay, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſuch a forme is come in the Spirit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes the ſame within him; for there are ſome formes and adminiſtrations, which hold forth Chriſt in the Spirit to come: now ſuch ceaſe to be in the uſe of them at his coming: as thoſe old Teſtament formes did hold forth as we ſay, Chriſts coming in the fleſh; which was both the ſubſtance of thoſe formes, and a more glorious adminiſtration of God: ſo it was in the decreaſe of <hi>John,</hi> and the encreaſe of this more higher and glorious adminiſtration: ſo it ſhall be in Chriſt his coming in the <hi>Spirit</hi> into every ſoules heart: then theſe formes that Chriſt appeared in, in the fleſh, ſhall ceaſe in his coming in the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſome Goſpel-formes doe ceaſe to none, but to ſuch as have enjoyed the enjoyment of Chriſt in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For as Chriſt led the Apoſtles from the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle-condition in his transfiguration; ſo he will when he appears transfiguring himſelf in every heart; as the Apoſtles, ſo every heart ſhall ceaſe to make any forme, yea, the New Teſtament-formes, Tabernacles to dwell in for ever; as many makes them now in our daies: alſo there are adminiſtrations which hold out Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come. Which</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is not to be practiſed before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to be practiſed after his coming. As I ſhall name one eſpecially. It is the adminiſtration of Praiſe, which is alone the work of thoſe that are Redeem'd, &amp; have the Seals of the viſion of God opened, and are caught up with God into Heaven, to ſing ſongs to <hi>Zions</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:174689:38"/> God in <hi>Zions</hi> language, by <hi>Zions ſpirit,</hi> in that <hi>holieſt of holies,</hi> which is the place of <hi>Zion,</hi> and thoſe brought into the God-head to ſing Praiſe: but now God in this condition is departed from them, to this heart, not to every own; being ſeen and enjoyed in theſe formes which do hold forth his thus coming into the heart: now none but thoſe who do enjoy God in a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpenſation, are to ceaſe acting in thoſe diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations or formes he yet continues his preſence to them in: for as God did ceaſe; and did not appeare in the forms of the old Teſtament, and they were no more to be uſed after the ſubſtance thereof was come, &amp; God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a more glorious adminiſtration: ſo will God depart and ceaſe to be ſeen in new Teſtament-formes or adminiſtrations; when both the ſubſtance of them is come, and a higher diſpenſation doth appear, leading the heart out of them to a more glorious and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate enjoyment of himſelf: This is <hi>to follow the Lambe whitherſoever he goeth:</hi> This is to hear a voice behinde man ſaying, <hi>This is the way walk in it: Iſaiah</hi> 30. 21. And to be led <hi>by a pillar of fire (Num.</hi> 9. 16, 17, 18.) and ſometimes by a <hi>Cloud</hi> to mans ſpirituall Reſt: and not to ſtand in and under one adminiſtration all ones daies, and to be in one place for ever: But to finde God leading dayly from one forme into another, until he bring the ſoul into the perfect enjoyment of him, who is the glory and ſubſtance of all formes: this, for the want whereof, makes many to make them their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles and Reſt, yea, their home; yea, their God, peace and happineſſe; which if they be taken away, their God is gone, and their peace hath taken its wings and flown away this is the reaſon why many in Church relations have a name they live, and yet are dead; that is, they have a name of Saints and Chriſtians, but they want the nature of them; they have a profeſſion, but want a poſſeſſion: This is the reaſon why many come
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:174689:38"/> to have a burning up in their ſpirits, and are brought to a daily loſſe, they run faſter into formes and Church relations then God did lead them; therefore in them God leaves them; for this reaſon the expectations of many are fruſtrated, which cauſeth nothing but death and ſorrow, when they have longed and preſs'd out after formes; and being members of Congregations, and the enjoyment of pure Ordinances, thinking to find ſo much in them, and to conceive ſo much from them; and when they come there behold nothing but d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is partly the reaſon of all the rents and breaches in all Churches Congregated; and why they cannot ſtand, is becauſe they were not lead by God into theſe forms; neither did they ſee God clearly go before them; but ſome by affection, ſome by miſ-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſome out of zeale; ſo that now very little of God appears, either in their coming in, continuing with, or parting from; thus being bound up in forms and living in them, and doting too much upon them, and rejoycing too much in them; and judging all that ſpeake not for them, or joyne not with them: yea, this is the reaſon why we are devouring one another, becauſe we all doe not look for, and expect that the glorious appearance of God will lead each man out of his diſpenſation and form, though never ſo low to drink into one Spirit.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:174689:40"/> teaching can reveal the life and center of ſuch a heart, but it is better experienced then can be declared, it is ſo tranſcendent a life and being. Yea, further, for any man to live ſo in God, as he enjoyes God in all, and ſeeth God the life and being of all; yea, it is not his judgement, but he findes all theſe things effectually within him.

                  <p>Now the creature being ignorant of any other work, he wreſts from this Scripture influence, as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and from thence concludes his enjoyment of God; and that now from ſome perſwaſions of ſpirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it to be the witneſſe of the Spirit, when indeed the creatures heart in this caſe is not upright, and he being in darkneſſe is not able otherwiſe to judge of himſelfe, or his condition; neither of his heart which doth tell him, that this his ſutability is upright: but the foul wanting the manifeſtation of light, he is not able to paſſe true ſentence upon the ſame, but Reſts and man makes his habitation here: and though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make Scripture the ground of his thus belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet it is his qualifications and ſutability to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which is the ground of his thus Reſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:174689:42"/> to apply himſelfe in ſuch a way of working like God, as he may the moſt prevail with the ſoul and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, and ſo keep the ſoul much below God. Now Scripture-way Satan thinking is moſt like Gods way, of any other; eſpecially when he brings in Scriptures ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the condition of the party: and ſo that he may cauſe the ſoul to beleeve, that at ſuch a time God was pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf; by caſting in ſuch a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſo ſutable; ſo as now his transformed work is the more ſurer, ſeeing it hath ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, Mans own Memory or fancy being upon ſome ſerious meditation, may in the ſame manner and way bring, and repreſent before the ſoul ſuch a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: and here lies moſt of the deceit of the fancy and imagination thus to work: this way, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Scripture into the thoughts of ſuch a ſoules fancy and imagination to drive on his own Deſigne, makes it as it were a noſe of wax to apply it to what uſe or way he pleaſe; yet he will make it the ground of his imagination and fancy: and ſo man this way, comes to Reſt upon a deceit and fiction, and not upon any ground in the glorious manifeſtation of God.</p>
                  <p>Now Scriptures it is true, do diſplay in a Myſtery, moſt Precious things; which if a ſoul did enjoy them, their thus enjoying of the Truth there diſplayed, would be a Reſt unto them: but ſo long as a man reads Truth in the letter without him, untill he can read it in the Spirit within him, there is little cauſe of reſt to ſuch a heart.

O when once a ſoul is brought into a Pinacle-condition; wherein he is brought to ſee the glory of much, then Satan labours to cauſe the heart to fall down and worſhip him; he coming ſmoothly, and bringing he promiſes of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, to back the truth of what he doth: and here after the ſoul is betrayed by repreſented glory in a promiſe meerly caſt in from Satan; wherein the ſoul falls down, and worſhips the very cunning work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the high exalting of Satan: and in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he is brought to ſee and apprehend high things, and is brought into a Pinacle to behold almoſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of every thing, made over by Satan to the Creature in a promiſe upon the Soules ſubmitting to him; and upon this Pinacle he ſets him, that is, he cauſes him to Reſt: and ſo the poor heart being not wiſe in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is deceived and betrayed; though the actions, knowledge, light, joy, Reſt of this ſoul be glorious and for God in his own eyes; yet it is but Satans transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into an Angel of light, reſembling or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and working in the Creatures heart, in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſeſt manner and ſhape God works in.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, Others being wounded in Spirit, and weary in ſoule, for the want of any glimpſe of God;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:174689:45"/> leaving no means un-attained, to get his ſoul cured and unburthened; and having reſted upon many falſe props before, and being unbottomed of them; he tries this particular, it being of a higher nature, and more likely to ſpeak peace unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> a running to Scripture, to finde out ſome particular promiſes ſutable to his condition; and having found out ſome ſutable Promiſes either preſently ſeems to ſpeak to him from a ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him; ſo it may be, being a conditionall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or elſe the ſoul meditates a while upon it, and it runs much in his thoughts, and at laſt he cloſes with it, ſtrikes this load and burthen at his ſpirit, here he drawes comfort and peace from it; yea, it may be ſo much as indeed the ſoul is mightily overcome in his ſpirits with joy, and can do nothing but rejoyce; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he Reſts, builds his faith as he cals it, and ſo concludes it to be a mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſtation of God.</p>
                  <p>I will nor deny but God may make theſe waies if in truth, cauſe of ſupport unto a ſoul in his travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Reſt: But for a Soul to ſtrike ſail, caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and have all the waves in his heart ſtayed, and his very wearineſſe of ſpirit, at this preſent put to a period, is as if the children of Iſrael had ſtayed either beyond the red Sea, or when God gave them Manna, before they came to enjoy a reall poſſeſſion of the land of promiſe: though God did this either to refreſh their ſpirits and ſo to under-prop them; or elſe to give them it at the deſire and repining of their ſpirits, to ſee how they would uſe it, or abuſe it. Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deſcription of a Saints ſpirituall travell, though God ſhould cauſe a glimps of glory or heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na to refreſh a heart, to be given to a ſoul in the view of a promiſe, yet for a ſoul to Reſt in this, and make it his habitation, it ſmels too much of mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite and abuſe of every diſpenſation, and a daubing up his ſpirit with untempered morter, and ſo hatches
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:174689:45"/> Cockatrice Egs, and weaves the Spiders Webbe; ſo that it is but a kindling of a fire, and manwarming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own ſparks; whoſe concluſion ſhall be death and ſortow; and before ever the creature knows what true reſt is, by ſweet experience, he muſt be brought to a death in all theſe.</p>
                  <p>But from my own experience of the fallacy of my own heart, and the contrariety of the falſe Reſts that I have gone thorow; I make bold to propoſe theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars to ſuch a heart: not intending to weaken the workings of God in any poor heart, though under low Adminiſtration; but only to diſcover the nakednes of man in the way of his own heart.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt of all, When did the Lord manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thy ſoul, and give thee a particular right unto, and intereſt in this promiſe; the application of which thou makeſt thy Reſt?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How was God revealed to thy heart in this promiſe? Or whether is it not the great neceſſity thou haſt of it, that makes thee fly to the promiſe; and ſuck ſweetneſſe, life; comfort, and Reſt from it? Or is it God in Chriſt clearly Revealed unto thee in the ſame? For it was neceſſity, that made many run to the Ark, and hang upon the outſides thereof, though none but thoſe that were within were ſaved. Scribes and Phariſees did challenge a propriety in God, and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall priviledges; but it was but from a ſutableneſſe of holineſſe, they had to the promiſe; and not Revelation of God in them, diſcovering the truth of God in them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What inward Teſtimony of God haſt thou for thy great joy, peace, reſt? And what is thy inward evidence, that witneſſeth the truth of what thou enjoyeſt? For every one that beleeveth, hath a Teſtimony within himſelf, 1 John 5. 10. And every heart that hath ever ſeen the appearance of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:174689:46"/> him, hath found a lively Teſtimony coming along with that Manifeſtation of God; which is the only proofe of the truth of what he enjoyeth, and not any Qualification, nor outward Teſtimony either of man, or from man, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, How was peace in this particular enjoyed by thee? Was it from ſome inward voyce of God, or diſcovery of the ſame? Or was it from ſuch a ſutable form of words to thy condition; either caſt in, or found out in ſearching? Or was it from a clear Manifeſtation of the glory of God in thee, ſutable to thoſe forms of words in the Scriptures without thee; whereby the forme of words came to be made good to thee: ſo that thy comfort, peace, ſatisfaction, or reſt, do not flow from the forme of words, as thou ſeeſt them in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture without thee; but from the enjoyments of God within thee, ſutable to that without thee?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, What glorious power of God was made out in thy ſpirit; in thy thus cloſing with promiſes? Thy thus cloſing may ſeem to be done in power, but the ſpirituall Coming of Chriſt in the manifeſtation of his glory, is ſo great, as indeed it is not ordinary, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, in the heart of him that knows his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>A promiſe Cloſed with before Chriſt come in the Spirit, may ſeem to be done in glory and power; by reaſon it may be, he could not before beleeve, nor live in that freedome or joy he now lives in; but the coming of Chriſt in the ſpirit, doth ſo farre ſurmount that, as indeed the other appears nothing, when this is come, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, Whether is it the Manifeſting of God to thee, that gives thee a right to the Promiſe, and from this thou cloſeſt with God? Or is it that ſutableneſſe in thee to the words of the promiſe, that gives thee a being whereby thou cloſeſt with it? If it be the latter,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:174689:46"/> it is not right: For all Promiſes are in Chriſt Yea, and Amen. And He is the ALL in them; and if he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, he gives a being to them: yea, to the creature to live in that being, as He is the ALL in them. So that the ſubſtance of every promiſe muſt come into the ſoule, and be revealed in it, before the form of words can truly pronounce comfort, peace, life, happineſſe or reſt to it: So as his Reſt is not upon the form of words, as in Letter expreſſed, but upon the being of it; which is God manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Now many a heart doth feed upon hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks, out-ſides, and externall formes of words; and fals ſhort of being caught up into his glory, and ſo reſting in the being of all Truth. Here it comes to paſſe, that the Creature makes every thing a God; and will ſhape and form out God according to its imaginations; and ſo labours to diſpoſſeſſe God; and to ſet up its own ſhape in Gods ſtead.</p>
                  <p>Now promiſes, whether they be ſought, or caſt in, they are to be no reſt unto any heart: for the words of the promiſe are like unto a figure or type, it teſtifies ſomething to be given to the Sons of men; but when a ſoule is in the poſſeſſion of thoſe things, then it doth not rejoyce upon the words holding out the thing; but upon the ſubſtance of the thing poſſeſſed in the heart: but many on the contrary hand, for the want of this, run after conpitionall promiſes; and when it ſeeth not the condition of the promiſes performed in it, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours after a ſutableneſſe to them; before not daring to apply them: but when he hath got his heart into ſuch a frame, as he imagineth to be ſutable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thereof, he Reſteth there; applying life and comfort from it; concluding he hath a right unto it from this particular: But if at any time he bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> the condition, his peace is gone; becauſe the cauſe of his peace, was his exact performance of the condition of the promiſe.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:174689:47"/>
                  <p> Secondly, But ſome are higher then this, and they ſee a vanity in this; and they lock upon Chriſt as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of the condition; and if he can but beleeve, Chriſt hath done it, and then he hath a right unto the ſame; whereupon he uſeth meanes to get his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment convinced of this, that Chriſt died for him; and in Concluſion, he gets himſelf convinced of the ſame; and here reſts, concluding the promiſes are his, becauſe Chriſt is his: when indeed both the ground of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and confidence is falſe: and ſo he comes to be deceived.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another, that Reſts upon promiſes before Chriſts ſpirituall Coming, is when a man hath laine in ſad darkneſſe and bondage, and hath a long time waited for a diſcovery of God, and at laſt ſome apprehenſions of Chriſt come into his underſtanding; whereupon he ſtands convinced in his own judgement that Chriſt is his: Whereupon he for the greater increaſe of his Reſt, Comfort, and peace, runnes to promiſes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes them, as having a right to them in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions by Jeſus Chriſt: Here is that which begets the ſtrongeſt confidence, that Chriſt is come in the Spirit; which works that joy and peace, the ſoule thinks ſhall never be taken from him; whereas after a while man is not ſo quick-ſighted, nor ſo clear enlightned, but it ſuddainly lyes in the grave, as that which muſt vaniſh in the ſpirituall appearance of Chriſt in the heart.</p>
                  <p>Now this is the great deſign of Satan, to keep the poor creature on the out-ſides, the husks; and would have the Creature wholly to live below the glory of Truth; which is the coming of Chriſt in the Spirit of glory: But hearts truly principled before Gods appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe next Reſt in order to this, is great, ſtrange, and excellent flaſhes of God (ſo I tearm them) and a they the moſt appear; yet they may be true, or falſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, or reall.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſhall ſpeak of flaſhes of light in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: And neither touch them as they are true, or falſe.</p>
                  <p>1. If they be but flaſhes, they are no reall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Chriſt in the Spirit: and therefore in the firſt place, They are not of a witneſſing nature, they bring no reall Teſtimony of God along with them; but leave the creature dark and empty, in and of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; but Chriſts coming in the Spirit is not without a Witneſſe, which is both unreſiſtible and ſatisfactory: but flaſhes whether they are of God, diſtinct, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite; they have no Teſtimony of the Spirit, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the truth of God to man, by the Spirit within man: as man is below under the diſpenſation of a flaſh; whether true or falſe.</p>
                  <p>So ſecondly, They are not of a powerfull Nature; they are very weake in compariſon of the power of Chriſt coming in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, They do not diſpoſſeſſe Satan of his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas the coming of Chriſt in the ſpirit doth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They do not diſpoſſeſſe the Creature of living in himſelf; or they do not carry up the Creature into the glory of God in the Spirit; they being of too low a nature, no more then flaſhes in a dark night, can bring the Creature into the beholdings of, and living in the glory of the Sun: ſo that they are not compleat Revelations of glory; neither powerful in effecting the ſame worke, which is accompliſhed in the coming of Chriſt in glory.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:174689:48"/>
                  <p> 3. They do not ſatisfie the heart of any; they may ſeemingly give contentment for the preſent; yet the ſpirit not altogether ſatisfied: whereas the coming of Chriſt in the glory of the Spirit, doth fill and ſatisfie the heart of any in whom he appears: Mal. 3. 10. Mat. 5. 6 yea, his coming cauſeth a running over of the ſouls Cup: yea, it is uncontainable, mans capacity not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to receive or comprehend the ſame: for the want of this ſatisfaction, power or witneſſe of the Truth of Chriſts coming, he being but under a flaſh, he runnes to Miniſters and men of experience, to hear their judgement, being not ſatisfied in himſelf; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their approbation and judgement, he moſt commonly receives the more or leſſe ſatisfaction; and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſts: whereas if it be Chriſts coming in the ſpirit, a ſoul need not run to any Creature in the World to be ſatisfied in the Truth of what is diſcovered; for HE comes with a Satisfactory witneſſe, which doth anſwer all objections and ſatisfy all doubts in the heart, which may ariſe: yea, if men inſtead of approving do deny it to be truth; yet the ſouls Teſtimony within it ſelfe doth bear up his ſpirit, that he is able to ſay, all men belye the truth, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 16. he not in the leaſt being daunted in his aſſurance thereof; though it be oppoſed by man or devil: neither can ſuch a heart be ſhaken, if all the men of the world ſhould ariſe againſt the ſame, coming to diſprove it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 25. 30. Alſo he that runs to any viſible externall witneſſe, pretending Chriſt is come in the ſpirit, is a creature altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his ſaid coming; and lives much below ſuch a coming: for to me this is an infallible Truth, that if any man pretend Chriſt is come into him in the Spirit, and yet wants an inward Teſtimony or witneſſe for it, and ſo is forced to make uſe of viſible Teſtators, he is a man plainly wanting the enjoyment of the ſame; for God in ſuch a caſe never leaves himſelf without a ſure,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:174689:48"/> ſatisfactory, unreſiſtible and undeniable Teſtimony; which indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe; they being perſwaded of the truth of what it enjoyes: But this is as much below the witneſſe of the ſpirituall coming of Chriſt as the light of the ſtars, is below the light of the Sun. How many under a ſtate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> flaſhes (which I may ſay is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the laſt Carde Satan can play in a ſoule to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in his transformings) do live in moſt great joy, light, notions, or pretended liberty; thinking from a meer perſwaſion they have within them, they live in very high enjoyments, and doe beleeve they have a witneſſe of the Spirit within them, for the truth of what they beleeve; when indeed it is but a formed imagination, and a Carde plaid gallantly by Satan, to keep the creature below the enjoyment of God in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Spirit, and to live in freedome and reſt, when not in truth and in the Lord Further this is the reaſon part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of many ups and downs in the heart, whereby the creature is one day a believing and another day doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it is not living in the enjoyment of Chriſt in the ſpirit; but may be is under ſome flaſhes, and ſo it comes to paſs that it is unſetled and unfixed in God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Flaſhes are of no long continuance, they are not of an enduring nature; for they preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, are preſently gone, and ſo though the Creature had a great deale of light and joy; yet when the flaſh comes to be taken away, away gos all the Creatures joy and light, and he is left in the cloudes of darkneſſe and ſorrow again; Whereas when Chriſt comes in the Spirit it is not ſo, then all ſorrow and mourning ſhall flie away, (Iſa. 60. 19, 20.) and the darkneſſe of the Creature ſhall be expelled, and God ſhall become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul an everlaſting light, Rev. 21. 3. 24. ſo that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:174689:49"/> God and the Lamb ſhall live in his heart; and be light and glory to him; ſo as his Sun ſhall never go down, but he ſhall live in the light of God, and the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>For his coming in the Spirit, is after the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſoul out of the grave, whereby he is carried up in the light and glory of God, from the deſcendings of that light and glory from God; ſo as there is a living in the light God lives in; and a ſwallowing up in the ſame glory God is ſwallowed up withall: but a flaſh leaves in its withdrawing the Creature in the ſame it found him in, if not worſe: for a flaſh of light or joy, is like a flaſh of light in the Skye; upon the darkeſt night it appears to be the greater, the greater the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is. So upon a darke ſoul, when its poſſeſſed with much darkneſſe, the leſt flaſh that can appear in that is very great and admirable; ſo that the heart being no otherwiſe able to judge, lookes upon it as a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, yea, may be a very glorious one: yet it is not ſo, and at laſt is taken away, and the <hi>creatures hopes</hi> and expectations are fruſtrated. Whereas to ſuch a ſoul as lives in the day naturall or ſpirituall, hardly can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne or take notice of ſuch a flaſh or light, becauſe it is ſo much inferiour to the light and glory of the Sun, and day; which now is appeared and ſhines either within him or without him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe flaſhes in the firſt place, if they be of Satan, the very end thereof is to lull the creature aſleep in the bed of ſecurity, and there is no reſting of the ſame by any poor creature: For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It workes and comes in ſutable to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures neceſſities, pretending redreſſe for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It comes with a glorious reſembled form or ſhape God workes in: and ſo it becomes a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Satan, and not a transfigured Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is not able to diſcern the ſame by reaſon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:174689:49"/> of the abſence of the true light which makes all things manifeſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 13, yea, the very transforming of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Flaſhes in this nature do come with furniture to back the truth of what it doth declare or ſpeak; if there be any jealouſies ariſe in the heart, as ſometimes there is, yet it doth furniſh him with ſtrength to mannage the entertainment of it, and his joy and peace from it: and here Satan plaies his part: for if the heart be of an opinion, that it is poſſible for a ſoul to doubt after he hath enjoyed a manifeſtation of God, then he will put a creature upon doubting, to make good that falſe, un-ſound, and un-experienced principle of men; that the trueſt faith is accompanied with the greateſt doubtings; and here the heart is ſtil deluded, and kept in ſtrong perſwaſions of the truth of his flaſh.</p>
                  <p>2. If the heart be of that judgement, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a ſoul can doubt again after he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a manifeſtation of God; Then Satan will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into a capacity of confirming the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in labouring in all transformed actions, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the creature in his aſſurance of the truth of what he enjoyes; and ſo upon all occaſions addes to what he hath done; and ſo the poor creature Reſts ſatisfied in and upon what the Creature calls his manifeſtations of God: now flaſhes that uſually attend a creature that is truly enlightned by God, though not fully poſſeſſed with God, yet he being waiting for the coming of Chriſt in the ſpirit, is ſometimes attended with flaſhes or light of joy: but they if from God, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have theſe enſuing effects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They do underprop and ſupport a weary faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, in his ſpirituall travell to his land of Reſt, ſo as he is made to wait with free ſubmiſſion to God untill it enjoy an appearance of God in the Spirit.</p>

                  <p n="2"> 2. Inſtead of cauſing a man to reſt, they declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and do diſcover the vanity to it of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſts it hath been reſting upon below the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in the ſpirit; ſo that it is ſo farre from it, as it is an Angell appearing, unto whom man would gladly fall down and worſhip (Rev. 19. 10. &amp; 22. 8.) yet it ſaith to the Creature, as the Angel ſaid to <hi>John, Worſhip me not:</hi> ſo ſaith the flaſh, reſt not upon me; I am but as a meſſenger from God; I am not the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God appearing in the Spirit; I am in the form of an Angell, I am not the God upon whom thou muſt reſt and worſhip.</p>

                  <p>THe next Reſt in order to this which partly the creature paſſeth through, is the appearance of God in formes and adminiſtrations, under which the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is mightily elevated in his Spirit; as <hi>Jonah</hi> was with his Gourd which God gave him; which workes a great diſpleaſure in the heart; when God would have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:174689:50"/> the Creature brought into a higher diſpenſation of God. Adminiſtrations I muſt confeſſe are appointed by God, and in the ſame he uſually appeareth in a low manner; ſo as he ſometimes doth give the Creature much refreſhment in the uſe thereof; but not to be the Soules Reſt, as though this were a full manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in the Spirit; but to ſet the heart in a frame to ſee by this, the great glory that ſhall be revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in the Coming of Chriſt in the Spirit: for thus it workes, If God be ſo glorious in a glimpſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a forme, how much greater will be the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of himſelf in the ſpirit; which inſtead of reſt, thus working, it is made to have a higher breathing in its ſpirits after the Reſt, which he ſees afterwards to be enjoyed from God: So that the heart is led by God through thoſe many diſpenſations of God, to ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, Reſt to be enjoyed from God, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enjoyed in theſe low Adminiſtrations, under which he breaths and lives: but others, they inſtead of this, reſt highly ſatisfied in their ſpirits, making i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As though the Children of Iſrael ſhould have ſaid, Here will we Reſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving we are in the Land of Canaan; when God led them under, and through thoſe many Adminiſtrations by appearing in the form of a Cloud of Fire; for I look upon this to be the very ſymptome of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reſt, we are a ſpeaking of. I do not condemn the Children of Iſrael, for their following the leadings of God in thoſe Adminiſtrations: neither do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any man who is in the uſe of formes; ſeeing God led them in: and unto the ſame; and that it is that which ſupports their ſpirits; namely, their ſeeing and apprehending God in ſuch a forme as the ſoule is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed

And as Chriſt cannot, nor ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be changed into any other form, then now He

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, The Goſpel Faith of Jeſus Chriſt (as men call it) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath ſome ground of Reſt, both from Scripture and reaſon, as they think.</p>
                  <p>Men in our daies have given diſtinctions of Faith, as namely, Hiſtoricall, Temporall, and Saving. But leaving the two former, I come to the latter, and ſhall un-boſome my ſad experience of deceit in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>1. Concerning this Saving Goſpell-Faith. I owne there is a Faith, which in Scriptures is termed Saving: yet that which men call both beleeving and ſaving, I find not to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of all, man cals true Faith, <hi>A dependence upon Chriſt,</hi> or beleeving Chriſt dyed for them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture. Now Faith is neither a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy upon Chriſt, or beleeving according to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expoſition, that Chriſt dyed for us; theſe, if they be ſo in the heart, as a Creature doth conceive, yet they are but the effects and fruits of Faith, in its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall act, upon or towards God; but this many make their Reſt and ſhelter; that if they can but beleeve, Chriſt dyed for them at Jeruſalem; and that thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving they can go out of themſelves, that is, onely deny their own righteouſneſſe, and beleeve that Chriſt is theirs, and that he dyed for them, this is a Reſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: when indeed the poor heart, is both ignorant what Faith is, and what going out of himſelfe is. For never can a Creature go out of himſelf to Chriſt or God, before there be a cleere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ifeſtation of God in the heart. Now the Creature who is thus Reſting upon his beleeving in Chriſt; is altogether ignorant of any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God to him or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n him. For Faith is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall and divine light of God communicated to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:174689:52"/> the ſoul, by the Spirit of God; which after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of light, the creature comes to ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of God; by which Faith he is made to beleeve; yea, which beleeving is an effect or act of the ſaid Faith, upon or towards the ſame God which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
                  <p>Now in the firſt place, Beleeving is not Faith; but an effect thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Beleeving is an act of God in us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſo no Reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Nothing which flowes forth from man to God, is to be a Reſt: No act whatſoever is to be a Reſt as it is purely exerciſed in man though of God: but mans Reſt; is to be one who acts all in man, who is God. Many men are thinking highly of themſelves: becauſe the Scriptures declare a Chriſt crucified for man; and they are made to beleeve he was ſo for them and ſo are made to deny their own works or doings: and to depend onely upon this Chriſt; which indeed the poor hearts be ignorant of, and know him not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have any manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt in them, in any particular way; but only from their own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fancies; they ſtil confidently beleeve that this Chriſt is theirs, and he dyed for them; and here they Reſt, and make their habitation; concluding this to be Faith, and the knowledge of Chriſt; which indeed if ſuch a Spirit knew what Faith were, or the knowledge of Chriſt were; this would be diſſolved, if not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it would finde it's faith and knowledge, to be an un ſound and un ſafe Reſt to be centred upon. So that I ſay, that that is not Faith, or beleeving which men ſo call: and if ſo, it were no ground to Reſt upon.</p>
                  <p>For, in the firſt place, A man muſt truly know within himſelfe what is Faith is, before aman can truely beleeve.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:174689:53"/>
                  <p> Secondly, He muſt alſo know what this Chriſt is he beleeves in, before he can depend upon him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve truly in him,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There muſt be a clear manifeſtation of God or Chriſt in man, before there can be any true knowledge particularly of him by man.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſts dying at Jeruſalem ſhall then be known to the heart in a more ſpirituall manner then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And the workings of that death, ſhall be found in that heart, to be ſuch as formerly it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, He ſhall know that dependency upon Chriſt and his former beleeving in Chriſt, the truth of which he hath formerly tryed by viſible ſignes and marks, is now made to be a fancy, not Faith; and an effect of darkneſſe, not of light. And now he findes another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and beleeving in him, flowing from another ground then before he knew; and that the matter he Reſted upon in hes own imagination, which he before called a Chriſt dying for him, is now changed; being it was but his carnall conceptions, and fleſhly teachings and actings: and now he is made to ſee the ſpirituall ſenſe; and ſo to judge of the truth of an ever-dying, yet ever living, transfigured, glorified Chriſt; ſo as now he is making his habitation, not amongſt the beaſts of the field in his former fancies and fleſhly teachings; but in the ſpirituall heavens, where live all Juſt men, made perfect; and all perfect men, made to live by, or in the life of God or Chriſt; ſo as he is changed into glory, and his Reſt is made glorious.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, When this is come to paſſe, men ſhall know really the Myſtery of Faith; and why it is called a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: and that ſame ſpirit ſhall know a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Myſtery of Faith diſcovered to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, coming as it were from God, and the keeping and exerciſing of the Myſtery of that Faith in a pure
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:174689:53"/> Conſcience to God: and that beleeving is not Faith, as it purely comes from God, diſcovering it ſelf, and the Myſtery thereof to the Conſcience: but it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that ſaid Myſtery of Faith by God, in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God. So that the Myſtery of faith in it ſelf is one thing, and beleeving and dependency upon Chriſt (if true) is another thing. But the effect or exerciſe of the Myſteriousneſſe of faith in a conſcience which is pure; to or upon a God that is pure.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Men may beleeve Chriſt died for them, and from this beleeving may practiſe ſuch things as are required by him: yea, may have ſuch peace &amp; joy in the ſame: And in this his own works, he may abhorre and deteſt, not ſetting them up with Chriſt: and this he may do from a Scripture notionary knowledge, onely got in the head, where he is ſwallowed up with his conception of his enjoyment of Chriſt and God by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and ſo may live in a way of Dependency upon Chriſt, as he is declared and ſet forth to dye for man at Jeruſalem; from which knowledge, beleeving, and dependency, there is begotten much deadneſſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, in which he may ſuffer and rejoyce, he may dye and live in it; exalting God much in word, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actions: and yet all this time ignorant of the ground and Myſtery of faith; yea, ignorant of the knowledge of Chriſt, which begets the true exerciſe, and living by faith: Yet if this which I now ſay were true, yet it were too low an Element for any ſpirituall heart to make his habition or Reſt; but in this ſame they are to be as men of hope, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 5. waiting for, and haſting unto the Coming of Chriſt in the Clouds, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 4. 17. where they ſhall enjoy and have a Diſpenſation of Glory; and ſo ſhall be for ever with the Lord: for the Myſtery of faith is the pure fight of an un-known, un-ſeen God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 17. and the pure ſight of God in this great Myſtery is from the pure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:174689:54"/> of God, is the Kingdome of heaven and glory, and this muſt be within, and enjoyed by every ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all heart.</p>
                  <p>This is the place of ſafety, where Saints Treaſure lyeth, and where they are to make their Reſt, habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abode, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. This ſafe Reſt is not procured by, neither is it a dependency upon one, a heard of Chriſt; but it is a carrying up a ſpiritual, crucified Spirit, into a glorious God; who was, and now is made manifeſt, to live with, to Reſt upon, and to have a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in, for Ever and for Ever: And here the ſpirit remaines in ſafety and in glory, triumphing in him, and being ſwallowed up with him, is carried up into the light and life of God; knowing him in all things, enjoying him in all things; ſeeing him to be the light and life of all things; being now gathered up into his will, is wholly diſpoſed by him, and therein with God is ſatisfied, and ſo Reſts: whereas mens beleeving is very unſound, and if it were not, yet its very unſafe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to change: And being it is but ſome exerciſe of ſomething in man, yet it being but an effect, it is not to be a Reſt; but man is rather to be carried above it, after the peſſeſſion of him who can give Reſt, and eaſe all heavy loades and burthens of the creature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11, 28. 29.</p>

                  <p>Now having diſcovered as many falſe Reſts as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I am free to diſcover, I ſhall in the next place ſhew how difficult it is, and how hard it goes with the creature, to part with theſe his falſe Reſts; which are falſe but in reference to his Reſting and abuſing the end for which ſuch a diſpenſation was given.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:174689:58"/>
                  <p> The Soul being in the firſt place, as I may ſay, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht upon them, making them his God, be they formes or what they will, when it ſeemes to be taken away, he being brought to a non-plus in his ſpirit: He cries, They have taken a way my God, What muſt I do? So that there ariſeth as it were a ſtorme within this creature, which begets a ſpirit of diſcontent in the creature; Witneſſe the ſame in <hi>Ionahs Gourd</hi> which God had given him, yet being abuſed in the end for which it was given; in the taking of it away, there was a ſpirit of murmuring and diſcontent. And thus it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, when creatures would be Reſting upon any thing below God; when God ſeems to take it away from the creature; The more the ſoul was glued to it, and Reſted upon it, and made a God of it; the more difficult and hard it goes with the creature to part with the ſame; yea, the more diſcontent doth ariſe in that heart.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, It ariſeth from the abuſe of our being glued to any Adminiſtration, ſo as not to uſe it to that end for which it was appointed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The cauſe partly of this ariſeth ſometimes from the greatneſſe of the loſſe it works in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in being to part with the ſame; as many ſoules it may be have ſpent the glory of their age and ſtrength; to patch up a Religion of their owne, and have taken much paines to accompliſh the ſame. It may be hath been twenty years a profeſſor, and hath all this time been labouring to patch up a Reſt, and having got one, in one moment God raiſes the foundation thereof; this works ſuch a loſſe in the ſoule, as indeed to have many a glorious gift burned up; yea, many a glorious day of joy, twenty yeares profeſſion in one moment laid in the duſt: and now to deny it ſelf in all his paines, and parts of wiſdome and knowledge; This muſt needs go hard and be very difficult with a poor heart, to part
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:174689:59"/> with all: And the Creature will have many ſhifts and puttings off before he will be made freely to part with all, and to deny himſelf in all.</p>
                  <p>The condition of ſuch a ſoul, is like a man that all his daies hath been taking pains night and day, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſome eſtate; and when he hath got ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he fals a building, and makes great buildings; and when he hath furniſhed the ſame, takes delight in it, and ſets his heart upon it; and behold, when he is ſolacing himſelf in what he hath got and done: In a moment there is a fire conſumes the ſame to the duſt; which being beheld by the party, he is amazed, and much perplexed in his ſpirit; upon which occaſion in ſome it begets death, in others diſcontentedneſſe and murmurings; yea, repinings of ſpirit, ſo as it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a day of ſorrow, but it continnues ſo: And this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties loſſe being exceeding great, and his expectation fruſtrated, he is now at a non-plus, not knowing what to do: So it is with a heart after God either hath given gifts, or ſomething below himſelf, or for the which the Creature hath been labouring all his dayes; and at laſt, having attained ſo much, as now he Reſts with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in a conceited happineſſe: When God comes to butn down this houſe, the ſoule hath been all his dayes building, though upon (it may be) a falſe foundation, he layes the Creature and his worke in the duſt; ſo as now the ſoul is ſtripr naked of all his conceited holineſſe, or righteouſneſſe and happineſſe, upon which ſight the creature is wrought into an amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and aſtoniſhment of ſpirit, wondring what God is a doing with him in this ſad condition, which works death, and ſorrow, and the grave, and nothing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſſe before; and a labouring to ſtand, and not to part with the ſame, untill he be forced to it by an unreſiſtible power: the ſoule before is crying, What muſt I be ſtript naked of all? What is all my praying,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:174689:59"/> faſting, mourning and the like, all taken from me; ſo as now I have nothing to Reſt upon: Muſt I part with all? Oh, eſpecially this creatures riches is hard to part with, as it was with the young man who wanted all things, in the want of one thing; who notwithſtanding had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the World, and I feare, too much of this wee are ſpeaking of; for he was nigh the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet to part with all for a Chriſt, Oh how loth he was: Oh this parting with all goes hard, makes many ſorrowfull either in reſpect of outward or inward rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: It is moſt commonly this inward riches which is the life of moſt profeſſors in our dayes, untill God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottome them of their profeſſions, and forms, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings and fulneſſe: and the moſt that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in our Land, I feare are in this particular: when poor creatures are ſo glued to themſelves, or formes, or their own righteouſneſſe and ſelf-riches: that indeed they live upon the ſame; and make a life out of it, and a God upon it: and ſo dwell, as though they were in heaven; when indeed they are neither in the way to it, nor poſſeſſed with it: But if ever God appear either to them or in them, God will unveile them ſo, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed though they have bin profeſſors never ſo long, and in the ſame are become rich in their own eyes, and in the eyes of others, yet I beleeve God will burne it up, and bring them to a loſſe; and make their high and lofty ſpirits lye in the duſt; as he hath done with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their condition.</p>
                  <p>I look that the greateſt loſers in our dayes, ſhall be the longeſt and talleſt profeſſors; though their loſing it may for the future tend to their greateſt gaine: yea, <hi>Englands</hi> profeſſors ſhall ere long, cry out of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward loſſes, more then their outward loſſes: and they ſhall be ſtript more naked in matter of ſpirituals, then ever they were of temporals; though in the loſſe of both it may be accompained with little freedome, but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:174689:60"/> rather unwillingnes at preſent, and repinings of ſpirit, though at the laſt they may be delivered from their ſtraits, and be cloathed with the Sun, and then ſhall trample the Moon under their feet; I doe not ſpeak of profeſſors in reference to any particular faction; but I ſpeak of all under what denomination or title ſoever, that are profeſſing God, before they be poſſeſſed with him; who are ſtoring up inward riches, but not of the Spirit, and Reſt upon it, as though it were of God; which when God makes it manifeſt by the day, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Scripture, 1 Cor. 3. 3. &amp;c. it burns and is conſumed, either becauſe it was not of God, or elſe becauſe it was Reſted upon below God: So that now to be brought out of the Creature and all its own ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſelf actings, are ſo contrary to it, and ſo for the annihilating of it; ſo that indeed man in and of himſelfe will oppoſe God, &amp; ſtand out againſt this work of annihilation: to have a Creature who before was rich in and of himſelfe, or from ſome adminiſtration of God, below the enjoyment of God in the ſame, and according to which, and for the want of which, the Creature makes his habitation below Heaven; though he lives as an Angell, yet as miſerable as any devil, in reference to his want of God in a way of enjoyment; it being thus with a poor heart, that to part with his falſe Reſt is ſo hard and difficult; How then comes the ſoul to ſee them to be falſe, in reference to his Reſting upon them, though they may be true as they are an adminiſtration of God, I ſay how comes the ſoule to ſee them to be falſe, and ſo either willing to have them either diſſolved, if they be adminiſtrations of God, or burned and conſumed, if they be of the Creature? In anſwer to this, we will ſay both waies in Scripture and experience. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God makes them known to the Creature, and him willing at laſt, to part with them, by diſcovering
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:174689:60"/> unto him, the emptineſſe of theſe diſpenſations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is made to ſee the non-ſatisfaction and un-ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, if continued in by the Creature; as thus, either by diſcovering unto a ſoule, the want of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in it, wherein it appears to be truly empty; or elſe by fruſtrating the Creatures expectation, in the not enjoying that from theſe things but in conceit; which it did expect to finde in them, and receive from them; and herein God hedges up the ſouls waies with thornes; ſo that now it cannot find that comfort and refreſhment in thoſe things which formerly it reſted upon and drew comfort from, now God making them empty and vain to the heart, it is forced to cry out as <hi>Solomon</hi> of the vanity thereof; and to ſay with them in the 24. of Iſa. 16. verſe, <hi>Our leanneſſe, our lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> ſo as now he is made willing to ſubmit to the burnings up of his expectation, by ſeeing the vanity of his conceptions in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By repreſenting to the underſtanding a more excellent Reſt and center for his ſpirit, both ſure and ſafe; this begets a breathing after the enjoyment of that Reſt which it is made to ſee without it, not as yet enjoyed by it (Iſa. 11. 10. &amp; 13. 16. &amp; 28. 8.) this ſame makes the ſoule willing to forgoe the one, that he may enjoy the other: For as <hi>Canaan</hi> was diſcovered to the Children of Iſrael to be more excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then that place of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was, wherein they were in bondage; which made them at their departure from it, to be willing to part with the Garlick and fleſh-pots: ſo it is with a ſoule in this caſe, the more the glorious Reſt of Chriſt is repreſented to any ſoule, the more it doth diſcover falſe Reſts, and the more it doth unbottome every Creature thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are diſcovered too and unbottomed off theſe Reſts, by the departure of God from any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; ſo as the ſoule deſires not to Reſt, where
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:174689:61"/> God is departed: for if it hath been thus with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the cauſe of its Reſt hath been the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, in ſuch an adminiſtration or diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet if now he ſee clearly that God is departed from it; he Reſts no longer; being the ground why he Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was and is taken away or removed: for as God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be in, and appear to his People, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the Adminiſtrations under the Law; yet not for everlaſting continuance; but that afterwards he did intend to withdraw his preſence from them, and ſo to diſanull the uſe thereof; ſo in any diſpenſation of God below his ſpirituall appearance in the ſoul, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to appeare at ſuch a time as himſelfe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, in the uſe of the ſame; but afterwards to withdraw himſelf from it, for ſome end beſt known to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now this is that I ſay, Gods departing and ceaſing to appear in a Diſpenſation or an Adminiſtration, Is that which both diſcovers the Reſting therein to be falſe, and is a further meanes to un-bottome the ſpirit of a man for making of it his Reſt any longer: for that Soul that is led into any Adminiſtration by God, in the which God appeares; when God withdraws from it, and ceaſeth to appear any more in it, the Soule doth the like alſo.</p>
                  <p>And in this he follows the Lambe where ever he goes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. So that I ſay, It is the departure of God from any condition (which if the creature hath been made ſenſible of it) doth repreſent the making a habitation in it, and the reſting upon it, is both below God, and contrary to him; ſo as in the ſame he is made willing to part with, and to ſee when God is known to be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed from, the vanity of making any thing his reſt though given of God, untill God do everlaſtingly appear within man, carrying up the ſoule and ſpirit of man into himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:174689:61"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, The next way God diſcovers theſe to be falſe reſts, and makes the creature willing to part with the ſame, Is by appearing in a more glorious Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to the Creature; and this is the reaſon why Chriſt comforteh his Diſciples, when the forme of the fleſh was to be taken away, by telling of them <hi>He, muſt go away, or elſe the Comforter would not come, Joh.</hi> 167. As if he ſhould ſay, unleſſe I depart in the forme of fleſh; or in this outward Diſpenſation, you cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy me in a more glorious Diſpenſation of the <hi>Spirit</hi> within you; which ſhould for ever abide with you: It is the Subſtance of what God intends to make manifeſt in your ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>I am but in this fleſhly diſpenſation a figure, and therefore I muſt depart, that I may more gloriouſly appeare within you; and lead you into all Truth, more glorious then yet you ſee or underſtand. It was ſo with John and Chriſt in the fleſh; as John did decreaſe, ſo Chriſt did encreaſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 30. It was indeed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of Chriſt in the fleſhly Adminiſtration, that made John in his Adminiſtration decreaſe: for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God in the fleſh of Chriſt, was more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then the diſpenſation of John; ſo that in ſpiriuals there is a giving way to a ſuperiour or more glorious Adminiſtration; by an inferiour or leſſe glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation: for the more of God appeares in any forme, the more glorious is that forme: now God did more appeare in Chriſts forme then in Johns; which made, John decreaſe and give way unto the diſpenſation of Chriſt: from whence I obſerve, That no man is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any diſpenſation, ſo long as God appeares in it, and makes it a living diſpenſation: for the Apoſtles were not to ceaſe walking with, or to depart from Chriſt in the fleſh untill God was departed from it, and ceaſed according to it or by it; but all the Apoſtles were to continue in that diſpenſation; ſo long as it was a living diſpenſation.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:174689:62"/>
                  <p> So it was with the diſpenſations under the Law; they were to continue in them ſo long as God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them and continued with them. So ſhall ſoules follow as God leads; As the Children of Iſrael were to abide in any place, ſo long as God abode in it: So we; And as they did move, when God moved from it, ſo are we until we are in our perfect Reſt, <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 17, 18. <hi>Heb</hi> 4. 9. For it is the preſence of God in a particular thing, which is both to be a ſoules Leader, Exo. 34. 14, 15 and his cauſe of ſtay in the uſe of any diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Unleſſe thy preſence go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, carry us not hence.</p>
                  <p>It hath been, and ſtill ought to be, That Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving out of one condition into another, or from one Adminiſtration or Diſpenſation into another, hath been by the preſence of God; either going, or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſuch a Diſpenſation: So that there may be a folly in this particular; for any man to ceaſe acting in formes, or in ſuch an Adminiſtration as God hath brought him into, and truly appeared in, untill there be a clear departure of GOD in the ſame, leading it into a more glorious Adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God ſeldome doth depart from one Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, until he appears in a more glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in another: As God did not depart from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Law, untill he appeared more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the adminiſtration of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>So it is now, That there can be no expelling clouds but by light, ſo there can be no other way to take off a ſoule truly from the uſe of any forme, until God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in a more higher diſpenſation. For as the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt in the fleſh was the ſumme and ſubſtance of the formes of the Law, and was not to be diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the ſubſtance came, Heb. 8. 1. Col. 2. 17. ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is now; The ſumme and ſubſtance of all Formes and adminiſtrations, is Chriſt in the Spirit; and untill
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:174689:62"/> the Subſtance of them be come perfectly into every heart, there can be no true ceſſation of that heart in Formes or Adminiſtrations. which are Goſpel-Formes or Adminiſtrations.</p>
                  <p>So that God departing ſometimes from an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and appearing more glorious in another, either within or without; is that which both unbottoms the ſoul of Reſting in it, and that which makes the creature willing to part with it. For the want of this the Jewes not beholding Chriſt, the ſumme and ſubſtance of the Law, Come in a more glorious Adminiſtration, they were unwilling to ceaſe acting in their former Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; the Veile being not taken away, 2 Cor. 3. 14. whereby they had been made to ſee the Subſtance of thoſe Formes, eſtabliſh'd compleatly in a Chriſt, Col. 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, the chiefeſt and onlyeſt way, why the creature comes to be willing to be moſt free to part with and to have a diſcovery of all diſpenſations below the appearance of God in the Spirit to be no Reſt, Is by the glorious manifeſtation of God in the Soule; whereby,</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, He appears as a glorious Light within man. And this Light</p>
                  <p>1. Expells all the Clouds from off, or out of the Creature; which kept the creature from beholding a reall difference betwixt a true Reſt and a falſe: So long as man is without this, no marvel then, though he be not able to diſcern whether his Reſts be true or falſe: But now when God ſpeaks in a Soul, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> ſoul, <hi>ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is Riſen upon thee, Iſa.</hi> 60. 1, 2. Then this true light ſhining into the ſoule, it makes manifeſt all things; whereas the Soule before had a veile upon him, and a Cloud over him; but now the glory of God is Riſen in ſuch a creatures heart, whereby he is made able
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:174689:63"/> to judge by the light of God dwelling in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it doth diſcover what is fallacy; ſo it reveals what is truth: it advanceth truth in the ſoule, though the ſoul before was ignorant, what difference there was betwixt the appearance of God in formes without him, and the appearance of God in the Spirit within him: of the difference betwixt a transform'd reſt reſembled, and a true Reſt in the Spirit manifeſted: of the end of all forms and adminiſtrations, with God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in them, without the creature, before the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſame be come in the glory of the Spirit within. Now this true light makes all manifeſt (John 3. 21.) and is a clear evidencing light within man; diſcovering Him who only muſt be the center and Reſt of the ſoule; which before it heard of, but now comes to ſee and experience the ſame. This light removes all obſtructions out of the Creature; and makes his judgement act according to this light within him; ſo that it is a light not onely expelling clouds; but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrates a reall difference betwixt truth and falſhood; ſo as now he is made to ſee, the place God hath ſet every adminiſtration or diſpenſation in, with the time, place and end.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This light makes not onely manifeſt things <hi>is they are John</hi> 3. 21. and ſo takes the ſoul off from them: But it doth diſſolve all thoſe adminiſtrations the Creature hath had without him, by the glory of God in the <hi>Spirit</hi> within him: ſo as the breakings of the day do diſſolve the diſpenſation of the night; ſo doth the dawning of the day in the heart of a Saint, diſſolve not deſtroy, any of thoſe adminiſtrations or diſpenſations of God, in which God did in ſome meaſure appear to the Creature: for as the night is of God as well as the day; yet the day doth diſſolve the diſpenſation of the night: So though many mens diſpenſations were of God; yet notwithſtanding when God appears, they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:174689:63"/> are diſſolved and do not now appear; becauſe a more gloriouſer manifeſtation of God within man hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Yea, this manifeſtation of God in the Spirit doth ſwallow up all other diſpenſations; ſo as now they are gathered up into the ſubſtance thereof, who before did ſend them forth; as the light of the Starres and the light of the Moone, are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed lights, or lights inferiour to, and ſent out from the Sunne; and when the glory of the Sunne appears, they all appear bodily and ſubſtantially in the Sunne: and as it is that the light dwels in the fulneſſe of it in the Sunne, and all lights are borrowed from or occaſioned by it; and that light is that which ſwallowes up all other, when it comes to appear; So it is with God appearing in the Spirit; he appears as the fulneſſe and the ſubſtance, or body of all other lights, <hi>(Col.</hi> 2. 17.) which are true, though ſent by God, in their diſpenſation, to accompliſh his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne: yet when God breakes into any ſoule in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Spirit, this ſhining of God into the ſoule (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 10.) doth ſwallow up all his former appearances in any diſpenſation below this; and gives way and ſubmits, and ſo gathers up and meets compleatly in the body and ſubſtance of them <hi>(Col.</hi> 2. 10. 17. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14.) which is God truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the ſpirit of fulneſſe and glory, this makes the heart free to part with any thing, though never ſo dear to it, which is obſtructive to, and keeps the ſoule from any enjoyment of this glorious diſpenſation; yea, this is that diſpenſation, which doth deſtroy all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, or formes, or diſpenſations that are not of God; what is of God before, ſhall be ſwallowed up in it; what is of man, ſelfe or Satan ſhall be deſtroyed by it, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 8) This is that which truly diſcovers to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oul all his falſe Reſts, though never ſo ſeemingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:174689:64"/> yea, though they be of Satans transformings, or of ſelf-reſemblings; yet it laies them all in the duſt, and unvailes them to the Creature; ſo as they appear in their colours and place; which ſometimes workes a mighty indignation in the heart, againſt the waies of his own heart (1 Cor. 7. 11.) when his lewdneſſe is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto him ſo as he is not onely made free to part with the ſame: but he is brought out of love with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for Reſting upon the ſame, ſo much below God or Chriſt. Again, in the manifeſtation of God, there is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; peace and Reſt poſſeſſeth the creature in ſtead of the other; this peace diſpoſſeſſeth the other peace; this ſatisfaction maketh nothing the other, whatſoever objection or diſ-ſatisfaction was before, or doth ariſe ſince; now they are all fully anſwered, and the ſoule compleatly ſatisfied; ſo as now he is brought out of a dunghill, into a pallace; from a mean condition into a glorious, to wit, even to live by the breathings of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth in him; ſo as now he lives, becauſe God lives and is ſatisfied with the flowings in of God, and eates of that which God eates of, <hi>viz.</hi> Love, Glory, and happineſſe. Nay further there is fulneſſe in this ſatisfaction; he fils the ſoul with himſelfe, and how can then this ſoule doe any other, but be free and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with any other ſeeming fulneſſe or good, when now he is filled with him that fills all in all, in all things, Eph. 1. 23. <hi>So as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 11. 9. ſo is the ſoul truly <hi>(pro tempors)</hi> filled with God untill he aſſwage it, or ſeem to be departed from it; or elſe enlarge the capacity of the Creature with more of himſelf: now ſeeing that God comes in with ſuch a fulneſſe into the heart in this diſpenſation; it muſt needs diſcover the emptineſſe and vanity of his other Reſts, and cauſe a ſweet willingneſſe to part with the one, and embrace the other.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, it comes in power: which day of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:174689:64"/> Gods power <hi>(Pſ.</hi> 110. 3.) makes the Creature willing to part with any darling, though never ſo dear and neer to him, both freely, cordially, and with much ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſpirit; whatſoever the day of God in it is light and glory doth diſcover to the ſoule not to be of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this the day of his Power doth accompliſh the ſame to the full in the ſoule; yea, though it be the life of a ſoul; yea; though it were its God and happineſſe in it, yet they all are nothing, when God and it ſtands in competition in the ſoule, whether of them ſhould be advanced.</p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt made manifeſt in a heart, and his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all coming into the ſame, is like unto a fire which burns up &amp; conſumes all things that are in the ſoul of his own, which keep the Creature below God, therfore ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming, or ſtand when he appeareth?</hi> And he ſhews the reaſon thereof, <hi>for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers ſope:</hi> to refiners fire he is compared: the appearance of Chriſt in the love of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> is like refiners fire, to refine &amp; puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, yea, to burn up and conſume in ſoules, what is not of the Spirit, and ſo to bring the creature to loſſe, though in the ſame ſalvation ſhall be made manifeſt, as according to the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 13, 14 where ſaith he, if any mans worke abide, which he hath built thereupon, he ſhall receive a reward: but if it burn, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> muſt be ſaved, yet it muſt be by this fire, which did conſume and burn up his hay and ſtubble: now as mans work ſhall be revealed by fire; ſo if it be not of God it ſhall be deſtroyed by the ſame: which fire is love, which is God: &amp; thus when he brings a ſoul, by his appearing, into the greateſt loſſe, then is he bringing a ſoul into the greateſt gain: ſo that that which proves deſtruction of his falſe Reſts; is that which brings him to the true Reſt; and ſo though it be a loſing for the preſent, yet his greateſt loſſe becomes his greateſt gain.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:174689:65"/>
                  <p> Now I know there are many Reſts that are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſſolved, before this day of his coming; and as there is one taken away, the ſoule findes and ſeeks after another; and runs from mountain to hill, to get eaſe of a tormenting <hi>ſpirit;</hi> ſo as man paſſeth through many Reſts, moſt commonly before this day; but now it may be the Creature hath ſuch glorious reſembled Reſts, that it cannot be found out before the day of God thus appearing, then theſe ſeeming Reſts are they which are diſcovered, upon the apear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of himſelfe in the ſoule: But ſome ſoules paſſe through more then we have ſpoken of; ſome through fewer; according as God keeps the ſoule, and alone becomes the leader of him: yet many ſoules that are come thus high, have found them by ſad experience, and others have found ſome of them, and others more; yet it is ſometimes Gods way to permit the Creature to run out after the waies of his own heart; and at laſt to hedge up his waies <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> 2. 6.) where many ſoules lie at this day in the wilderneſſe, not knowing what to doe; being non-pluſt in their own ſpirits; not knowing what God is a doing, nor what he will doe; what they muſt do; ſit ſtill they cannot, act they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but in their old Road.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewed the many Reſts Soules paſſe thorow and the difficulty of parting with them; together with the waies and means God makes the heart willing, that now he may enjoy that true and unchangeable Reſt of ſoules, which ſhall be the next we ſhall ſpeak of, and that is, What this true Reſt is; in which the ſpirit of a ſpirituall man muſt be centred.</p>

Yea, the Reſt of Saints is the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his glory; which glory is Chriſt, when he comes to be manifeſted in his Saints, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It wholly takes up the Creature who is Centred in it; ſo as now the ſoule or ſpirit is wholly ſwallowed up of God; and unexpreſſibly overcome is ſuch a ſoul: The glory of God, which is Chriſt, is that which ſwallows up mens ſpirits; and the more it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in them, the more it overcomes them; ſo as now they are taken up in their ſpirits, being gathered up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; with nothing elſe but it: So as now the ſouls delight, joy, ſolace, is now alone in nothing but in him, who is become a glorious Center to him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Reſt of Saints gives Saints full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: the full ſatisfaction of Saints lyes in living and Reſting compleatly in this glory, which truly is Chriſt; ſo as man ſometimes is loſt in the greatneſſe of it: The leaſt manifeſtation of this glory doth fill the creatures capacity; ſo that untill the capacity be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with more of God, it can deſire no farther enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diſcovery of it: ſo as now his ſpirit is filled with glory. And that which makes it the more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, is the Centering of the ſpirit up in it. Now Chriſt in the Spirit becoming a Saints Reſt, all other ſeeming glories (which before the ſoul was ſheltred under and lived upon) are now vaniſhed and decayed; and the greatneſſe of this glory, which is the Viſion of God; yea, the manifeſtation of his glory in man, takes up man into it, to live wholly in it; and ſo to remaine in compleat ſatisfaction and contentment of ſpirit; for a great part of a ſoules Reſt conſiſts in this very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to wit, the gloriouſneſſe thereof together with the ſwallowing up of the creature with it, and the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:174689:67"/> the ſpirit a compleat contentment in it: for it would be in time a place of wearineſſe, unleſſe it were a place giving the creature full contentment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It would be no place for Saints to delight and ſolace themſelves in, unleſſe they could be wholly taken up, and ſwallowed up with that which of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be enjoyed from it and unleſſe it did exceed all glory that could be imagined, it could be no reſt for the ſpirit of a ſpirituall man: So that it muſt be an unexpreſſible glory ſwallowing up of men ſpirits with it; and giving that ſpirit compleat ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in it.</p>

                  <head>The fourth deſcription of true Reſt.</head>
                  <p>IN the fourth place, This Reſt is a carrying forth of the Creature, out of the creature, into the place, where he had his firſt being, to live for every in him who is now become his manifeſted being.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, before we ſpeak of the Reſt it ſelf we will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                  <p>That there is no true Reſt for the creature in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for if man either reſt in his pure naturals, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any refined property in himſelf, he reſts out of his proper Element: I mean, as he is a ſpirituall man: yea, it is both unſafe and unſound ſo to doe: neither can man with any ſolid delight, or true contentment, reſt in or upon any, either pure naturals, or refined proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or parts within himſelf, though man could attain to his firſt principles and purity, yet if he reſted upon them, he would live below the true Center of Spirits: for indeed the reſt and proper being of all ſpirits, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe that are renewed, is the Eternal Word of God: which Word is Chriſt, who made all things in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:174689:67"/> the World of nothing, into which nothing they are to return: But the ſpirits of men or eſpecially that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſpirit of Saints, that came downe from the Father of ſpirits, who begot this ſpirit in them, not by fleſh, but by himſelf in his ſpirituall breathings and actings in the Creature; which ſpirit of man cannot live in any true element, neither can it live ſatisfied untill it come into its proper and originall being, from whence it came: for every thing is in its right place when it is returned into its originall, and place from whence it was derived; ſo that the ſpirit returnes to God that gave it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 7, and the fleſh of the man into the duſt from whence it was derived: ſo that man as he is carnall and fleſh, it cannot be poſſible that the ſpirit of any ſhould take much delight in the ſame, ſo as to make it the ſatisfying Center: But yet after it is renewed, it may be compared to <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, it ſees the Deluge, and looks abroad in the fleſh: to the Mountain of former ſelf-actings, and pure naturals, yet it cannot reſt in the ſame, neither can it take any delight therein; but is made to return to the Arke Jeſus Chriſt; who though he is in the ſoul, yet above it; as the Arke above the water, ſo Chriſt above the Creature, though within it, as the deluge in the world; ſo that the Creature as man, is no fit place for a renewed ſpirit to be centred up in; but he muſt by divine power be brought out of himſelfe, into that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall being of ſpirits, who is ſaid to be above man though in man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 6. as the Arke above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, though in the world.</p>
                  <p>Now man cannot Reſt truly in himſelf. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The place into which the Soule is carried, is and was the firſt being of his ſpirit, and now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted ſo to be to the creature; which being was Chriſt: this Chriſt was Gods eternall thoughts of Love, in which man had a being, and now comes in time as a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:174689:68"/> Being to be manifeſted in the Saints; ſo the one was the unknown Being of Saints before time, where they lay in the Love and heart of God, which nothing could remove them out of it: the other Reſt, is the known Reſt and Being of Saints made manifeſt unto them in time; which knowledge begets a returning of ſpirit, who with much wearineſſe of ſpirit have been waiting for ſuch a day of redemption <hi>(Luke</hi> 21. 28.) that it might return into its firſt originall and being, and to be fully ſecured in its God, which before it neither knew nor did experience; So that after the heart hath a diſcovery of this Being, it is like a Load-ſtone touching the Needle; the Needle can ſtand no way but towards the North and South; ſo with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man, after it is touched with his Being, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manifeſted, it is not able to Reſt in all the glories or excellencies that can poſſibly be imagined, until it be returned into its being: he is like a wicked man or man of this world, who cannot act but in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement: and like a Fiſh whoſe element is in the water: ſo with the ſpirit of man, he cannot act in his right ſphere, untill he come into his firſt originall Being, which is Chriſt in God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. ſo as now it acts in God, and lives by God, and is iaken up with God: and cannot live in any thing elſe, not as a Saint.</p>
                  <p>So that the trueſt compariſon that can be made of ſuch a ſpirit, is the Needle, and the Dove, which truly holds out this to us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Chriſt, the Arke is the center, and the ſure being of the ſpirits of Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is no ſafety or true Reſt for the beleeving ſpirit, but in this Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That it is impoſſible for any ſpirit who knowes Chriſt truly to be his Reſt; being once touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the divine and holy being of Saints, to Reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame; though many things may transform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:174689:68"/> within the Creature like unto it, yet upon them he cannot Reſt, no more then can the Needle towards the Eaſt and Weſt; but it is truly known by ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit not to be his firſt being and originall; and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it, as Chriſt did Satan in his temptation; but is carried forth the more in vehe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>The fifth deſcription of true Rest.</head>
                  <p>FIftly, It is the centering up of a ſpirituall man in a ſpirituall place, not made, nor created, but a being of himſelfe, ſtands by himſelfe, having his dependency upon none elſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Here is the ſubject matter of Reſt, and that is the ſpirituall part of man, which is created again and born of the <hi>Spirit, Iohn</hi> 3 3 for fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt of all, no uncleane ſpirit or thing ſhall come there; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. nothing ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it, but that which is become ſutable to it; That which is borne of the Spirit is, that which muſt enter into this Kingdome of Reſt and peace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſpirituality which is made in the Creature, is produced by God poſſeſſed in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; for as a carnall heart cannot live in God; no more can God manifeſt himſelfe in any unpure ſpirit; ſo as God before he manifeſt himſelfe to a Spirit, he makes it ſutable to that glory, which ſhall in meaſure be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto it; So alſo before God give man reſt in himſelfe, he ſets man of himſelf to live in himſelfe; for no carnall minde or will can attain God, before by God it be attained; and before God manifeſt to the heart the Creature is attained by him, he workes a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:174689:69"/> worke of the New Birth in him; ſo that if man were carried up into God which is impoſſible before he be born of God, there is ſuch a diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the purity and holyneſſe of God, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and carnalneſſe of mens ſpirits, that the Reſt of the ſoul could be no Reſt; for there would be nothing but war and enmity: ſo that God alwaies puls down mountains of fleſh, pride, and ſelf; and makes the crooked waies of the heart plain, Luke 3. 5, 6. and brings down thoſe falſe Reſts and Chriſts in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſo after makes known a glorious Center to the creature.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſpirit being made ſpirituall, by being born again, it is made ſpiritually to judge, receive, and diſcern the Truth of this glorious and ſpirituall Place, 1 Cor. 2. 15. which no man in the fleſh, or by the fleſh can attain to, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. whom never any man in the carnall mind hath ſeen, nor can ſee: So that mans Reſting place, together with the ſubject Reſting in it, muſt be ſpirituall and out of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now ſecondly, This place of Reſt is ſpirituall, ſo that man if he be in any true Reſt, it is not carnall formes or ordinances, which ſhall ceaſe: Neither is it the rareſt Qualifications, or expreſſions of creatures; neither is it glorious apprehenſions or puffings up of fleſh, no, our Reſt is beyond theſe, as far as the light of the Sun is from the Candle: He is an unexpreſſible ſpiritual being, One who makes all things ſpirituall that are ſpirituall, by that ſpirituality in the fulneſſe of it that dwels in him: He is the expreſſe Image of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. yea, he is God equall in Nature, though inferiour in place, operation or expreſſion: He is One in all things; He is above all things, and in him all things confiſt, Col. 1. 17. So he being the fulneſſe and the cauſe of ſpirituality, he himſelfe muſt needs be ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ituall. So that any ſoul centred up in him, lives
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:174689:69"/> above all carnall Formes, Ordinances, Qualifications, common holineſſe or fleſhly puffings up, either in falſe apprehenſions, or in inward deluſions; He is none of theſe, but is above theſe, which is the ſpirituall mans Reſt: And this ſpirituall Reſt is nothing but God, who is all and none beſides him; who enjoyes all in himſelf, and we in him; and by virtue of our being made, born and begotten of him; we become one with him, and of him: So that now being borne of him, it is impoſſible that the Nature of God in us, can Beſt or be fatisfied but alone in him and by him, it being of an everlaſting and infinite nature: but now as it is infinite, and of God in us, ſo it throws off all below God; and wholly and alone returnes to him and Reſts in him.</p>
                  <p>Now thirdly, This Reſt is not any thing Created, or depending upon any other power but its own. Chriſt as he was in the fleſh, is none of the Reſt of Saints: He is a Reſt of them, as he becomes one with them in the Spirit; ſo as he is one with God, and we with him; One in God and we in him, 1 Cor. 6. 17. Joh. 17. 21, 22, 23. Yea, very God, and we by him, 1 Cor. 8. 6. 15. 45. So that he is a Spirit not made nor created, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and creating all things for and of himſelfe, Col. 1. 16. Rom. 11. 36. And all by him was created, not as he was in any form or ſhape in the fleſh without us, not ſo to be a Reſt; but as he is God made manifeſt in the Spirit within us: However men deem of him, yet he is the Eternal Spirit, and the Father of all ſpirits, Heb. 9. 14. Though diſtinguiſhed from the Father in divers acts, ſhapes or formes, yet he dwels ſubſtantially in the God-head, and in whom dwels all the power and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, Col. 1. 19. 2. 9. And though he might be in the form of fleſh as man, yet then he was in the power and fulneſſe of God as God: So that he is in, and of Himſelf; and he that knows him aright, knows that ſaying.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:174689:70"/>
                  <p> And he that is experienced in that ſpirituall union and conjunction, will ſay, That his Motion, Glory, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and all others that can be ſpoke of, dwels ſubſtantially in him; and that by him now all things are both preſerved and kept, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. So as all other reſts below this, are none at all; but only for them that know not this ſame Eternall Being.</p>
                  <p>But now this Chriſt, He being ſuch a Myſtery, and there being in the Earth ſuch diſſention about him, To give true Definitions of him, I will in the next place ſet forth what this Chriſt is, who is the reſt of Saints. We have in ſhort ſet forth Chriſt the Eternall Spirit to be the Reſt of Saints: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

For to looke upon Jeſus Chriſt as he is in the Father, and ſo a ſpirit, we are to looke upon it, that all Voyces that are ſpoken from the ſpirit within us, are voyces of God, which for diſtinction ſake is tearmed Chriſt: for as he was in fleſh, he was not this internall Word; for the externall Word of God, became a Chriſt in the fleſh; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14. ſo doth the internall Word of God
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:174689:71"/> within us, become a ſaving Jeſus to us; the one without us, before our time in the figure, which was to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and not to continue in that forme and ſhape for ever to us, and ſo not to be Reſted upon; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Word of God within us; is a diſpenſation of God which cannot be taken away or deſtroyed, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides for ever; ſo as in the 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 14. <hi>I have written unto you young men, becauſe ye are ſtrong;</hi> which ſtrength was the abidiag of this Word within them; which Word was Chriſt, which they from God had ſpoke within them. Now this Internall, externall Word of the Spirit of Chriſt, this Word is faithfull and true; <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. 13. yea, unchangeable; upon which the Saints Spirits do Reſt and live.</p>
               <p>2. This Chriſt is a clear manifeſtation of God within us: He was the manifeſtation of God when he was in the figure, which was in the fleſh, there God was manifeſted in a myſtery? which myſtery was Chriſt; now as Chriſt without us was God manifeſted in the fleſh; ſo Chriſt within us, is God manifeſted in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: This Chriſt within man; cannot be revealed in any fleſhly forme, but he muſt be revealed as he is in the Spirit, one with the Father; yea in the Father: So that when God clearly reveales himſelfe in any ſoule; this which is no revealed is nothing elſe but himſelfe in Love handed out by this Revelation Chriſt; ſo that in Scriptures He is called the viſion of God. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p>3. Here he is diſtinguiſhed to be Gods Viſion; which Viſion is nothing elſe but a clear manifeſtation of God within the Creature, formerly made cleare to the underſtanding of the Creature, to be unrevealed and enjoyed by it: So as now it teaches the ſoul perfect and infallible Truth, after manifeſted to it: for as Chriſt in the fleſhly forme, was appointed to declare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal God to us, and ſo Chriſt called Chriſt God, they being manifeſted in the ſame forme: So it is inward,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:174689:71"/> the end of this terme: Chriſt within you the hope of glory, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 27. was, becauſe He was God clearely made manifeſt within them, which had been a myſtery hid, but now was made manifeſt to his Saints; ſo that the great Myſtery of heaven, is Chriſt, who is the clear manifeſtation of the Father in the heart of Saints.</p>
               <p>Again, we ſee it plainly declared in the 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. 2. <hi>For the Life was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it: and bear witneſſe, and ſhew unto you that Eternall Life, which was with the Father, and was manifeſted unto us:</hi> here the Apoſtle doth plainly make manifeſt unto us That Eternall Life which was Chriſt in God, was in time manifeſted by God, which manifeſtation of Life was Jeſus Chriſt: So that He is termed ſometimes to be of the Father, ſometimes to come down from him, ſometimes to be the Father, and ſometimes to be the Viſion of him, and many other expreſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> there are given of him: from whence I note, that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly every making forth of God in Mercy and Love to his Creatures are commonly called Chriſt: for the difference betwixt the term of the Father and the Son doth not ſo much conſiſt in Nature and Being, but in name and working, or diſpenſation: all the acts of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and love and light are called Chriſt in us, becauſe it is a ſpirituall diſpenſation of God in mercy and love to us. Now Chriſt as he is the cleare diſcovery or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of the Father to us, ſo he becomes a Reſt of peace and happineſſe in us; and ſo that this Chriſt, who in name is called the Manifeſtation of Love, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in reference to the being: and cauſe of this manifeſted Love which is Chriſt; for if we conſider him as the boſome love of God: He is not ſo Chriſt to us, or in us, but as this comes to be manifeſt to us, which manifeſtation, or the thing manifeſt is onely Chriſt: for I look thus, that not onely Chriſt as he was in the fleſh, was Chriſt only in that form, and no more,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:174689:72"/> but what ever was manifeſt, either by or in that form, was in Name, the Chriſt, and in Nature, Chriſt in God: now Saints Reſt is not in Chriſt, as manifeſted only in diſtinction, but Chriſt is the Reſt of Saints, as God hath deſigned him for that purpoſe, and ſo comes by God in Saints to be made manifeſt; carrying up Saints to live in the full glory, power and ſplendor of that God who did make manifeſt himſelf in this manifeſtation which is Chriſt: And no other way come ſoules truly to know the Father, either in love or mercy, but as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth manifeſt himſelf, in this very particular Chriſt revealed in mens hearts, in which men may ſee God clearly, and for the want of which <hi>Philip</hi> was ignorant, when he ſaid to Chriſt, Joh. 14. 8. <hi>Lord ſhew us the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it ſufficeth us.</hi> They were ignorant what the Father and Chriſt were in the ſpirit, though Chriſt were with them in the fleſh: and the reaſon was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt within them, was not by God made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to them therefore would they have been making Tabernacles in ſuch a low fleſhly knowledge, where in truth they knew nothing of him, in relation to the ſpirit, nor of that conjunction betwixt him and the Father, that whenſoever Chriſt ſpiritually was made manifeſt, there the Father was manifeſt alſo, becauſe there was one undevideable nature and being, in ſuch caſes betwixt the Father and the Son: ſo that the Saints Reſt is in this clearly manifeſted; God within us who in tearm and Truth is called Chriſt: ſo that now as Chriſts center was in the Father, and now is to dwell in the fulneſſe of his Glory, ſo Saints being in him are carried by him to live with him in the ſame glory and love; and to conclude this, when we can ſay from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in the <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. That when it pleaſed the Father to reveal his Chriſt in him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:174689:72"/>
               <p> 3. Chriſt ſpiritually diſcovered in men, and ſo knowne by them, and ſo becoming Reſt to them, is a clear light of God in the Creature, which light and glory is onely Chriſt: and thus he is often deſcribed in Scripture, not onely as he was a light in the fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, preſcribing rules of light to us, but chiefly, as he ſhall become the light and glory of God within us, for as he was in the forme o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fleſh, he was a myſtery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; yea, he was not ſuch a light ſo as God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, becauſe he was then but in the figure, holding forth what he would worke, and what he ſhould be, when he was to come in the glory of the ſpirit within men; for his being in the fleſh was a very dark diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: For even the Apoſtles, who were the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with him, did know little, and were very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the truth. So as indeed they thought he was come to ſet up a Kingdome in the fleſh, and that he would advance them in ſome great place: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</p>
               <p>So that it was Gods great deſign which was held forth in that forme of fleſh, which is the ſum of that Scipture, where he is declared to be the light of the Gentiles, and to be the glory of the people <hi>Iſrael, Luk.</hi> 2. 32. Now to prove it by Scripture, that this Chriſt is in the ſpirituall coming and advancing in the ſoule a glorious and Divine light.</p>
               <p>We ſee it very clear from that Scripture, in the 60. of <hi>Iſa</hi> 1. 2. Where the Lord declares the manner of Chriſts ſpirituall appearing in the ſoule: <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy Light is come, and the glory of the LORD is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen upon thee.</hi> This ſame Scripture, though men do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to deny it to be meant of Chriſts appearance in any particular ſoule, yet he that hath found the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt within him hath found him fully making good theſe ſayings. The matter however that here is promiſed at the raiſing up of diſtreſſed ſpirits, is Light
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:174689:73"/> and Glory; which light is God, appearing in a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of light and glory, the which diſpenſation is Chriſt in us, for he is both the light and glory of God, and all things that are either ſpirituall, light or glory diſcovered is Chriſt; for according to that Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 23. The glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. As if he ſhould ſay; when the Lord comes to dwell ſpiritually, in the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of glory within the ſpirit of man, and ſo ſet up a Temple in the creature, according to the 22. verſe. Then ſhall all thoſe lights, which before the ſoul hath been guided by, whether they were flaſhes or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled light, now there ſhall be no need of the ſame, but the glory of God now ſhall there be to enlighten the ſame: yea, Chriſt ſhall be the light thereof; ſo that he ſhall be filled with true light; whoever hath the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearance of Chriſt within him, he ſtall become a compleat light unto that ſoul: So as he ſhall not ſtand in need of any inferiour light, but they ſhall be diſſolved, when the glory of the Sun appeareth; ſo that in ſuch a ſoule to whom Chriſt is become in this manner a light unto, he ſhall have no night there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in the 22. of <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. verſe. But the Lord ſhall fill ſuch a ſoule with light, yea, he ſhall give to ſuch ſpirits Him, in whom there is no darkneſſe, as in a ſpirituall diſpenſation, and as he is termed in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. verſe. He is here called, <hi>The true Light, which lighteneth everyman that cometh into the world.</hi> He is here called true, in oppoſition to fallacy; as if he ſhould lay open many falſe lights in the world, and within men; yet he was come as a true light to diſtinguiſh betwixt true and falſe: and ſo he is a diſtinguiſhing light in every ſpirit who hath received him; for though Satan hath transformed himſelfe into an Angel of light in deceiving a creature, yet notwithſtanding when his true light appears in any heart, it doth both diſcover
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:174689:73"/> it and deſtroy it; according to that in the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. That though the myſtery of iniquity and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chriſt be never ſo deceiveable and glorious in their workings and transformings, both within and without the creature, yet Chriſt ſhall reveale and deſtroy it with the ſpirit of his mouth, and the brightneſſe of his coming. And true it is, that Satan both in matter of formes without us, and workings within us, is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelfe now, if ever. And truly he, within ſoules, workes like God, and there is no known di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt his transformings, and Chriſts work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; untill there be a true transfiguring of Chriſt in the glory of the ſpirit; and this doth find out all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite both of heart and Satan; for indeed there is no forme, though never ſo glorious, but he will transform himſelfe in it; there is no working of the ſpirit within man, but he will reſemble it; ſo that none ſhall be able to know, whether it be true or falſe, within him or without him, untill this Chriſt ſhall appear in light and glory, and ſhall make the ſame manifeſt; ſo as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his thus appearing is compared to the riſing of the Sun, and the dawning of the day, which are degrees of diſtinguiſhing light, which doth diſſolve the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect light of the Moone and Starres, and is a clear light of it ſelf, to rule and order, to unfold and diſcover the truth of every thing, which under the other diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could not be diſcerned, and that is the reaſon that the Apoſtle tells them, that they have a ſure word of propheſie, whereunto they doe well if they take heed: And he tels them how long it was, untill the day dawn, and the day-ſtarre ariſe in their hearts. This ſaying (untill) preſcribes and ſets out the limitation of time, and the accompliſhing of the ſame; as if he ſhould ſay, there is a moſt glorious day to be enjoyed in Saints, which day ſhall appear; but for your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untill that day, you have a ſure word of propheſie,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:174689:74"/> unto which if God give you care thereof, may be as a rule unto you. It being a light ſhining in a dark place: and though for the preſent you walke by the ſame, yet Reſt not there, but waite for the ſpirituall coming of Chriſt within you which in this word of propheſie is held forth to you; and then when he comes, he ſhall be a perfect light within, which light ſhall ſpeake truth, and leade the ſoul thereunto: but in the interim, Looke to that ſure word of propheſie, which declares and makes manifeſt the truth thereof. This word of Propheſie was the Scriptures; this day dawning, and day-ſtarre ariſing, was the appearance of Chriſt in the fulneſſe of the ſpirit within them. So as he often in Scripture is called, the bright Morning-Star: and as concerning his ſpiritual coming, he is ſometimes term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the notion of the day dawning, or breaking; as in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 17. and in many others, onely to ſhew unto us, that the breaking in of Chriſt into a heart, is like the breaking of the light in the earth, when the day begins to appeare, and the night is expired; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the riſing of the Sun; to that purpoſe he is often called the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, which ſhall ariſe and be ſeen in the hearts of men, ſo that we ſee this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, yea, himſelf is a true and glorious light of God in the ſpirits of Saints, ſo as he makes all things manifeſt to ſuch a heart, whether true or falſe; and this light ſhall cloath every Saints ſpirit, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour and transformed lights ſhall be under ſuch a ſoules feet, triumphing over them ſeeing the fallacy of them.</p>
               <p>Then Firſt, it is this light Chriſt, within the creature who appeares as light, which doth expell or diſpell all thoſe Clouds which are with creatures in whom he hath not appeared: for as the Sun doth expell the clouds in the appearance thereof, ſo Chriſt in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhinings forth and breaking in into every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:174689:74"/> ſpirit, ſo as the creature before could not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend God by reaſon of theſe clouds that lye upon the ſoule, now he apprehends him clearly, the cauſe being by Chriſt taken away.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By this light Chriſt doth diſcover all the falſe Waies and Reſts of the creature, either in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, or being below the true and ſubſtantiall way of Reſt: ſo that this light Chriſt, in his divine Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances within the creature, doth bring a day of loſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many ſpirits; when it diſcovers unto them the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their ſpirits, in running after the waies of their own hearts, and here they come to ſee the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of formes or former flaſhes; and now, it may be, all the ſoules knowledge and practiſe muſt lye in the duſt, and be unlearned: ſo as this light brings the creature out of love with his own Wayes; ſo that now he is free to be led according to the teaching of this light.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This light, Chriſt, in its ſpirituall appearing in the creature, doth reveale and diſcover the Father in this light, Chriſt, ſo as the heart clearly ſees and knows the Father and the Spirit, the ſon and the ſpirit One, and the ſpirit to be both: ſo as this light, which in reference to name, is called and tearmed Chriſt, yet it is God in this light, ſo that God is ſaid to be light in him is no darkneſſe: The Father is the fountain of light, the ſon is the manifeſtation of light or the light made manifeſt: now here the ſoul in whom this true light doth appeare, doth know God, and him thus ſent into the heart by Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that Chriſt as he is the Reſt of Saints, is a divine revelation of light; in which light and glory, the creatures ſpirit ſolaces it ſelfe; and reſts with much delight in the ſame; and out of this form, after enjoyed, will not Chriſt appeare, but will be unto ſuch a ſpirit an everlaſting light: that now as God lives in light, ſo the creature lives in light alſo,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:174689:75"/> which no creature in the fleſh can attain to, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeen, felt or heard, in the fleſh, in this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he is above it, conſuming of it, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally advancing this light more &amp; more in the creature; ſo as this light comes to be advanced, and appears in greater fulneſſe, ſo ſhall the ſpirits who are centred in it be advanced by it; and the greater this light doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in fulneſſe, the more perfect doth the ſouls Reſt appear, and the more ſhall the ſpirits be filled with it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the fourth place this ſpirituall Chriſt, or what he is in the Spirit, when he comes to be the Reſt of Saints. He is ſpirituall and Divine Life, without which no ſoul hath ſpirituall or eternal life enjoyed by him: for as a man without the ſoul is dead, ſo are all men, without Jeſus Chriſt within them made manifeſt: ſo that <hi>Iohn</hi> very fully laies open this truth, 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 1. 1, 2. for the life was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it, and bear witneſſe, and ſhew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifeſted unto us. So that we ſee what the life of Saints is, for that life which they here ſpeak of was Chriſt: Secondly, we ſee the place where it centers before it is made manifeſt; and that is laid open to be in the Father. Thirdly, the way whereby they knew it, and alſo to be theirs, was twofold. Firſt by the manifeſtation of it. Secondly by opening the eies of a ſouls underſtanding, wherby they come to ſee that life, which now to them is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: further he is the life of Saints ſpiritually conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, Coloſſ. 3. 3, 4. here he ſaith, <hi>when Chriſt our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory.</hi> So that he is here Saints life called, and more fuller ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in every heart, who hath found him fully made manifeſt within their ſpirits: again he is the life of Saints, as he becomes the ſpirituall reſurrection of Saints: for before ever God bring any Creature into the enjoyment of himſelf; he brings the creature into
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:174689:75"/> a ſpiritual death, not in the body, but in the ſpirit, and being laid in the grave alone: Chriſt as he is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life of Saints, muſt be their reſurrection, I mean the reſurrection of their ſpirits, from this ſpirituall death, as he is a diſpenſation of life; and therefore it is written: Joh 11. 25. <hi>I am the reſurrection, and the life, he that beleeveth in me, though he were dead, yet he ſhal live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Chriſt as he is to become the ſpirituall life of Saints, proves an inward reſurrection to them in the manifeſtation of this their life; which indeed <hi>Paul</hi> did experience, when he ſpake theſe words, Gal. 2. 20. I <hi>am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſſe</hi> I <hi>live, yet not</hi> I, <hi>but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> So that though <hi>Paul</hi> had been buried into Chriſts death, yet notwithſtanding when Chriſt came to be manifeſted to him, then he proved a reſurrection of life in him; and by this life was <hi>Paul</hi> made to live: for untill Chriſt our life comes to be manifeſt, we lye dead, voyd of any ſpirituall life or motion in us: and this was figured out in the matter of <hi>Lazarus</hi> death, when Chriſt came he found him dead and buried, voyd of life, or motion; wherein at laſt the very breath of Chriſt, breathed out in way of voice, <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth, raiſed him up, and gave life unto him, Joh. 11. 43, 44. Two things are here ſpiritually hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forth: Firſt a ſpirituall death of Creatures when Chriſt comes to breath upon them the breath of life. Secondly, by his thus coming, ſpeaking, and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſions life, becauſe his words are ſpirit and life thus ſpoken: ſo that it is ſaid, The hour is coming; and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear, ſhall live. Now in all this is held forth unto us, The ſpirituall reſurrection of all Saints by Jeſus Chriſt, coming in the ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:174689:76"/> that which moſt men doat of ſo much after death. So that if we look upon our ſpirituall reſurrection, we ſhal ſee that the coming of Chriſt in the Spirit is a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Spirituall life, which proves a ſpiritual life; which proves a ſpitituall reſurrection in ſuch creatures; and in time their reſt and center: Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Saints life is Jeſus Chriſt. Though before they are making out of their own actings, according to the law of wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks, do this and live, yet now they ſee that that life is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the cauſe of all actions to God, flowes from this life principled in them: and though they are making a life out of enlargement, or holineſſe in converſation, yet this is a life above it, unbottoming the creature off from it, and centring the creature in a ſtable and ſolid life; Secondly, the Saints live, becauſe Chriſt lives in them; for though before their lives were hid with God, yet they were not to live in reference to themſelves, with joy and peace, untill it were made manifeſt from God in them: ſo that they are made to live from the manifeſtation of life in them, whereby they come to know it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This life is the motion of his ſpirit; ſo as by this life he doth not onely live, but lives to it; ſo that the creatures ſpirits are wholly ſet apart to live to God: This life is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he living in the ſpirit, and not in the fleſh, hereby
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:174689:76"/> comes the life of Saints to be a life of love, and a life of God, becauſe they are not at reſt from all their own labours, and now all things are acted in them, by that Spirit of life, which is Chriſt dwelling in them: now Saints wholly live to God, by the life of God in them, and thus are Saints centred up in God, or Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſpirits are carried up above the creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, which is Chriſt in them, becoming ſpirituall and eternal life to them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This ſpirituall Chriſt, as he comes from God, and is manifeſted by God, and ſo known by us, and become Reſt to us, he is ſpirituall redemption and deliverance: Now to look upon Chriſt in the ſpirit he cannot be manifeſted, but he becomes a ſpirituall Jeſus, that is, a Saviour of ſpirits, for he was not a Jeſus as he was in the fleſh, but he was a Jeſus, as he was to come in the Spirit; for the fleſh could not do it: Yet it was a figure of that ſpirituall ſalvation and liberty, which Chriſt is in the hearts of Saints: For indeed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is ſalvation it ſelf, and where he is in power and glory there is ſalvation; that is, he is a Saviour, or a deliverer of the creature out of that ſpiritual ſlavery, &amp; bondage in which he lives: So as he is become free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and redemption to the heart; and therefore he is ſaid to be made unto us Wiſdome, and righteouſnes, and ſanctification, and redemption, that is, he is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in us, and ſo is become ſpirituall redemption to us, freeing us ſpiritually from our inward bondage and ſlavery, both that bondage of ſelf and Satan, whereby we are made to live in ſpirituall freedome: and all this freedome and deliverance is Chriſt in the ſpirit, as he is a ſpirituall diſpenſation deſigned of God for the ſame purpoſe; though many ſouls do work out their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by their doing, whoſe ſalvation is falſe, others naving ſalvation from ſome falſe chriſt, which workes and acts like this Chriſt; yet the Son hath ſet neither
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:174689:77"/> free; neither doe they know that alone redemption ſalvation and liberty, which is produced by Chriſt, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or appearing in any heart; ſo that the ſpirituall Reſt of Saints is in and upon that ſalvation, liberty and freedome, which they have in this Chriſt, who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this unto them: ſo that all heavy loads and yoaks are removed, all oppoſitions of ſpirit are taken off, and all the wearineſſe of ſpirit removed; ſo that now the ſpirits are ſet free, and can no more come into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; but Chriſt alone is become ſalvation and liberty to him; ſo that the ſpirit doth ſolace it ſelfe and Reſt in him, who is become freedome and ſalvation to him.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Chriſt the Reſt of Saints ſpiritually known, is the wiſdome of God in creatures: the wiſdome of God in Saints is Jeſus Chriſt; and there it is ſaid, <hi>He is made unto us wiſdome,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. So that it is the Wiſdome of God, which is Chriſt ſpiritually known, in which Saints Reſt. For if they Reſted in the wiſdome of the fleſh, that ſhould be deſtroyed, and ſo no ſafe reſt and center for them: but the Wiſdome of Chriſt doth unbottome Saints from their own wiſdome, and eſtabliſh himſelfe, even the Wiſdome of the God-head in the creature, to be a reſt unto the creature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before the Soule and ſpirit were not at reſt; being from its own wiſdome, plotting and contriving, which way to act and what to doe, not from the Wiſdome of God; but from the wiſdome of the fleſh, onely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and gain-ſaying this wiſdome; Which when the Creature could not bring about, what in his owne wiſdome he had contrived; he muſt needs be perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo continue in all trouble; but now he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in that; and he is made to reſt upon the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, Chriſt now taking the Creatures place, and acting in the ſtead of the Creature; ſo that the ſoul is made to walke in and by Wiſdome; it is that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                  </gap> for this reaſon, is occaſioned all jarrings and tumults: But the Wiſdome of God, which is Jeſus Chriſt, is peaceable, it workes abundance of peace and quietneſs in the ſoul, Church or Nation, where it onely is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; here is a quiet and peaceable habitation, for Saints to Reſt and live upon: we ſee Chriſt often in Scripture called the wiſdome of God; and as 1 Cor. 1. 24. where the Apoſtle declares Chriſt, in all that are ſaved, to be the Wiſdome and power of God; though this Wiſdome be little eſteemed of by the world, yet it is highly precious in the eſteem of Saints; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that of the Proverbs 3. 15. ver. where that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is precious, yea, more precious then Rubies; yea; he is expreſſed to be an uncomparable compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo that this wiſdome of the eternall Spirit, which is Chriſt in us, is deſirable, and therefore above all things, ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Get Wiſdome,</hi> Prov. 4. 5. yea, there is a happineſſe in the enjoyment of it; for it is the principal thing that belongs to a Saint, Pro. 4. 7. ſo that Saints are eentred up in the wiſdome of God, and are wholly delivered up into it, to be alone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by it: ſo that the ſpirit lives in ſweet quietneſſe and Reſt; the creature being wholly made nothing in his own Wiſdome; and the Wiſdome of God alone or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all things in him.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That which ſpiritually is called Chriſt in us, is that Peace which is ſpoken by God to us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God by us; in which Peace we live and Reſt; ſo that Saints are kept in the Peace of God, which is Chriſt; to this purpoſe is the ſaying in the Eph. 2. 14. <hi>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:174689:78"/> 
                  <hi>hath broken down the middle-wall of pertition between us.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſets forth Chriſt to be the peace of the Saints; for whatſoever tends to peace in the Creatures ſpirits, that, I mean which truly tends to the ſame, is Chriſt: for the ſoul before he appears in it, is like unto the ſhip toſſed with the waves and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; before Chriſt ſaid unto the waves, be ſtill; this is that peace the Apoſtle deſires the Saints may enjoy, which was the <hi>Peace of God which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> Phil. 4. 7. which was of ability to keep their hearts in the knowledge and love of God; now this is that Saints ſpirituall Chriſt, a peace which is able to keep them in the love of God; and a peace which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the underſtanding of the Creature; that is, a Peace which the underſtanding of man can never finde out or is abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to reach under; yea, all the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in the world is never able to finde ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch a peace for the creature as this is; ſo that he ist termed the Prince of Peace, Iſa. 9. 6. All the acts of Chriſt in the ſpirits of Beleevers, are Righteouſneſſe and Peace. It is that peace which the world cannot give; and ſuch a Peace it is, as they cannot take away: When God ſpeaks Chriſt into a ſoul, which is Peace, in which none can cauſe trouble in ſuch a ſoul; becauſe Chriſt is become the Peace thereof; indeed men may ſpeak Peace, and Ordinances may ſpeak peace; and falſe gods and chriſts may ſpeake peace; after which there may be trouble occaſioned: But after God ſpeaks peace, there can none cauſe trouble; but the ſoule lives and is kept in the peace of God; ann none can make him afraide: therfore the Prophet did utter theſe ſayings: <hi>He ſhall be our peace, when the Aſſyriant comes into our Land.</hi> This Chriſt is the peace of Saints in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition; ſo that they live in much freedom an joy, becauſe the center and reſt of their ſpirits is peaced</p>
               <p>And laſtly, This Chriſt is Righteouſneſſe and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Saints, or ſanctification; this not only by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:174689:78"/> experience, but by Scripture may be proved: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tels the Church of Corinth, <hi>That Chriſt of God was made unto them wiſdome and righteouſneſſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaction and Redemption</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1. 30. So that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and ſantification <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made unto them ſo that whatſoever is Righteouſneſſe in the Spirits of ſaints, is <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpiritually dwelling in them; this is that righteouſneſſe that the Apoſtle deſired to be found in, this is that divine nature which the ſaints are made partakers of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He ſhall not only be called ſo by them; but he really ſhall be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> over ſo by God to them, ſo that the Righteouſneſſe of God in us is Jeſus Chriſt made ſo by God to us, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Righteouſneſſe, a Righteouſneſſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes all ours in the fleſh, and makes us live in the righteouſneſſe of the ſpirit; ſo that now beleevers in this kind, ſhall not be found naked, but cloathed with Chriſt their Righteouſneſſe, they ſhall not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for they ſhall be made to ſtand in the righteouſnes of another. And to be covered with the robes of the Lamb, made beautifull by Chriſts beauty, and comely by his comelineſſe; ſo that the ſame ſhall dwell in the ſpirits of ſaints, that dwels in the ſpirit of God; and that ſhall be made a beleevers, to be imployed for God and to God, now beleevers who are made to Reſt in Chriſt, are imcompaſſed about with truth, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in which their ſpirits ſhall live with freedome and unexpreſſible joy for ever.</p>
               <p>And now as this Chriſt dwels in them, as a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God; ſo he carries them up in their ſpirits to live and Reſt compleatly in God; ſo as now they live where Chriſt lives, which is in the boſome of God; ſo
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:174689:79"/> that the great deſigne of God in this Chriſt ſpiritually coming is wholly to gather up the ſpirits of Creatures into the Spirit, to live, dwell or reſt therein; and to this purpoſe he is called the Power of God: and indeed he is ſo divine a power, come forth from God, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the great deſigne of God in the ſpirits of Saints: and therfore Saints find ſometimes that this Power works in them mightily, and never ceaſes till it gathers up the creature wholly into God, to reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly in him: So that to conclude all, when Saints are truly at reſt in God, then in the firſt place, the will of the creature ſhall be centred up in the will of God: and ſo the will of God ſhall become the will of the creature: ſo as the will ſhall ceaſe acting any thing, but what is acted by the will of God: ſo that the Will of Saints ſhall be gathered up into the will of God: and their will being centred up in his Will; Here ſhall it be ſaid, the creature hath ceaſed from his own works, as God did from his, Heb. 4. 10. and now his will Reſts in God; though before the will was bent againſt God, and would not be limitted, but all things muſt be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on according to the will of fleſh; but now it acts ſo no more, but now with Chriſt, not my will, but thy will be performed: ſo as now his will is at Reſt, he wils nothing of himſelf, it is carried on by the Will of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The mind of the creature is centred in the mind of God, ſo that creatures minde one thing with God, and the ſame principle of truth is poſſeſſed in the mind of God: So that now the mind is wholly made ſpirituall, and none but God doth poſſeſſe it: ſo as now the mind doth ſolace it ſelf &amp; takes ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in God: whereas it may be a ſmall time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did not dwel in the mind, but corruption or ſin at that time; there was not ſuch ſolace in God, but rather in luſt and ſin; neither did the mind delight
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:174689:79"/> in God, or reſt upon him: whereas now being ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed with it, is ſweetly made to live above all in God, who is now become the eaſe and reſt of the mind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The affections of men are centred up in God, and wholly ſwallowed up with him: So as now the creature lives in heaven; That is, with his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the preſence of God with great delight, and ſo he comes really to dwell with God: nothing can come and take up this creatures affections, being they are Placed upon God, being made ſpirituall by God: So they act as God acts in them; yea, the affections of the creature and Gods are made both one: ſo as they wheel both from one principle, and by one and the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Love moves Gods affection, if it can be ſo ſaid, ſo it moves the creatures affection to God: God is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with the creature, and the affections are raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God: he delighteth on the one hand, and the creature on the other: So that Chriſts and Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and joy are both one.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Spirits of Saints are at Reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are eaſed of all heavy loades and burdens: Chriſt hath given them Reſt, who are eaſed and unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened of every yoak and burthen: ſo as now his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe is at an end, and no more in his ſpirits, but all taken away, and his ſpirit lives in compleat liberty and freedome,</p>
               <p>Fiftly, He is ſet free, and is at reſt whom God hath made to ceaſe from his own works, and now God works all in and by his Spirit: That though he hath bin a long time travelling towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet now he is got within the land. That now God flowes in upon his ſpirits with immediate feedings and refreſhments; and ſo now fully ſatisfies the heart with all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and deſired: ſo as the Spirit lives in compleat ſatisfaction in all things as he is ſweetly poſſeſſed with him; who is become all things to him, and by this acts
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:174689:80"/> no more in himſelf, nor by himſelf, but now it is that he is dead thereunto: and is ſo quickned in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as that now the worke of Gods Kingdome is made exceeding glorious and is carried on exceeding gloriouſly: So that not by arme or ſtrength of the creature, but by the ſpirit; The creature being ceaſed from all ſelf-actings, this ſoul truly that Reſts in God. Further he is at Reſt in God who hath truly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the ſtate of inward reſurrection, and now is Aſcended into God; for as Chriſt in his fleſhly form was not at Reſt, becauſe he was not aſcended, ſo no more is the ſpirits of any ſpirituall man at Reſt in God, untill after his ſpirituall reſurrection he be aſcended into God, to dwell compleatly in God, for Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the manifeſtation of the Spirit begets a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in us, and the powerfull effects of that life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets an aſcenſion of our ſpirits into God; So that now the ſoul having aſcended, can no more deſcend into theſe low things which keepe below, and ſhort of his glory; but when he appeares in the Spirit within us, and diſcovers his glory to us, it doth ſo overcome the ſpirit, as indeed it is caught up with it, for ever to live in it; for impoſſible it is that the ſpirits can live below God, which occaſioneth trouble and wearineſſe, who hath before truly lived in God, by the vertue of God made manifeſt to live in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is impoſſible that any ſoul can live, and Reſt in God, and ſo aſcend into God, before there be a manifeſtation of the life of God in the creature; for it is God deſcending in his appearance or manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in us; That both begets a reſurrection, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of us, ſo that we aſcend by deſcending, and live &amp; Reſt in him by his being manifeſted to live and Reſt in us; ſo that in this particular the creatures life is ſwallowed up, and gathered into the life of God; and as God continues living in them, they ſhall continue
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:174689:80"/> living in him: and as God hath taken up them to be an everlaſting reſt for himſelf, ſo he hath appointed &amp; made himſelf an everlaſting Reſt unto them: ſo that now they are aſcended in their ſpirits into God, and there ſweetly live in God. And laſtly, he lives ſweetly in God, and ſo reſts in him, who hath God in him, to be an everlaſting light in him: ſo that his ſun never goes downe, nor Chriſt in him never ceaſes to ſhine forth in light and glory to him; ſo as according to that ſaying; <hi>There ſhall be no night there,</hi> Rev. 21. 25. ſo alſo Rev. 22. 5. Though ſome thinke that this is a very high ſtate; yet experience and Scripture do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, That it is a ſtate enjoyed, or ſhall be enjoyed, by all or moſt Saints in theſe our dayes, Iſa. 60. 19, 20. we ſee the promiſe God makes with his people is this.</p>
               <p>That the LORD ſhall be unto them an everlaſting light, and God their compleat glory, Iſa. 60. 19. Yea, in the 20th verſe; <hi>Their Sun ſhall no more go down, neither their Moon withdraw it ſelf: for the Lord ſhall be their everlaſting light, and the dayes of their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be ended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee that in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſt place, there is a ſtate that ſoules may be clouded in, though they have precious workings of God upon them. Secondly, this ſtate is attended with mourning. Thirdly, there is a degree that is above either; where there ſhall be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther withdrawing of light, or clouding, where all mourning ſhall fly away; but the ſoul ſhall be filled with divine light, and God ſhall never cauſe any more clouds to come upon ſuch a ſoul, but his light ſhall be everlaſting, and the glory of God ſhall fill his ſpirit for ever; ſo that God ſhall become the glory of ſuch a ſpirit, in which glory the ſpirit ſhall reſt for ever; ſo that there is a fulneſſe of glory to be enjoyed in the ſpirits of the ſaints when God doth dwell in them, and become a diſpenſation of glory to them; I ſpeak this
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:174689:81"/> in reference to the ſhallow capacity of the creature, and that fulneſſe of glory to ſatisfie the ſame in every appearance of glory within the Creature: ſo that now when ſaints come to enjoy this diſpenſation from God it being an everlaſting diſpenſation of God in them, which cannot wax old or decay: ſo are they made to live unchangeable in the ſame: And this is the ſtayed Reſt of ſaints: For one thing there is in this: That no ſoule can truly Reſt in any diſpenſation unleſſe it be a diſpenſation which abides for ever, and cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, ſo as his Reſt cannot be diſſolved likewiſe, ſo that to Reſt thus is ſtayedly ſure, and everlaſting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſhable, and undiſſolvable: and alſo he reſts in God who lives in everlaſting joy and peace, ſo as nothing can diſturb his peace, nor diſſolve his joy, ſo as to cauſe either to ceaſe. For come what condition will upon the body, yet his ſpirit is ſwallowed up with joy: he doth not powre upon creatures as formerly he did: but now he lives by rejoycing, and rejoyces by living; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him is a trouble to him, ſuch a trouble as touches his ſpirituall joy: He receives alwayes, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes alwayes, and depends alwayes, ſo that his ſpirits are kept in everlaſting joy and peace, and all ſorrow and mourning is flown away: no more ſorrow of ſpirit is know by him, neither doth he experience any more ſpirituall pain within him; but inſtead thereof is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd peace and joy for evermore.</p>
